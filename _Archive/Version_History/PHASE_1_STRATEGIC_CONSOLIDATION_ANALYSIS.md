#### Content Handling Rules

**For overlapping content:**
1. **Identify most comprehensive treatment** - Usually from Doc 2 (Brain_Criticality_Research)
2. **Add unique perspectives** from other docs as additional paragraphs
3. **Consolidate citations** - If same paper cited in multiple docs, cite once with full discussion
4. **Remove redundant explanations** of basic concepts

**For unique content:**
1. **Integrate thematically** - don't preserve doc-by-doc structure
2. **Maintain all substantive claims** - ensure nothing lost
3. **Add cross-references** - "As discussed in Section X..."
4. **Create unified narrative** - reads as single author, not patchwork

#### Citation Management

**Overlapping citations:**
- Beggs & Plenz (2003, 2004) - Cited in all 3
