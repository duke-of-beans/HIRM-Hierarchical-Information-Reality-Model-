# Temporal Continuity and Information Persistence Through Phase Transitions: A Comprehensive Literature Review (2020-2025)

Research in consciousness science has made remarkable progress bridging discrete neural dynamics with continuous conscious experience. **This review identifies 63 high-quality papers establishing that continuous phenomenal experience emerges from hierarchically nested discrete processes operating across 15 orders of magnitude—from femtosecond quantum oscillations to multi-second cognitive episodes**. The convergent finding: temporal continuity arises not despite but because of multi-scale discrete dynamics, with information persistence mechanisms operating at each transition point.

## Multi-scale temporal architecture reveals nested integration windows

The brain maintains conscious continuity through hierarchical temporal processing spanning vastly different timescales. Each level employs distinct mechanisms for information persistence, creating seamless experience from fundamentally discrete processes.

### Quantum and molecular timescales: femtoseconds to microseconds

**Quantum-classical bridging mechanisms** provide the foundation for temporal integration at the fastest timescales. Sergi et al. (2025, *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience*) present a rigorous quantum-classical Hamiltonian framework describing Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR) in microtubules. Their model demonstrates quantum coherence persisting for 10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁴ seconds in microtubules, with **π-electron resonance oscillations at femtosecond scales** bridging to conscious moments at millisecond scales through gravitational self-energy collapse (τ = ℏ/E_G).

The quantum-classical transition employs mixed Weyl symbol/matrix-valued Wigner functions embedding quantum operators in classical baths. Experimental support includes Bandyopadhyay's findings on fractal "triplets-of-triplets" microtubule resonances spanning terahertz to kilohertz frequencies, and anesthesia studies showing quantum coherence disruption (Kalra et al., 2023). The **time-reversal symmetry breaking** at quantum collapse creates perceived temporal flow, with classical neural modulation between discrete quantum events generating experiential continuity.

Critical for dimensional bifurcation theories: each Orch OR event represents a discrete conscious moment (~100ms duration), yet orchestration synchronizes events across entangled microtubules, creating coordinated information integration. The mathematical framework uses symplectic mechanics coupling classical variables to quantum operators through quasi-Lie algebra structures, demonstrating **information preservation through quantum-to-classical phase transitions**.

### Neural oscillations and binding: milliseconds to seconds

**Cross-frequency coupling networks** coordinate temporal binding across neural timescales. Siebenhühner et al. (2020, *PLOS Biology*) provide definitive evidence using combined SEEG (59 patients) and MEG (19 subjects) that phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and cross-frequency phase synchrony (CFS) create systematic spike-timing relationships binding information across frequencies. Theta/alpha phases (3-14 Hz) couple with gamma amplitudes (30-100 Hz) at ratios of 1:2 and 1:3, with **CFS strength predicting cognitive performance** on neuropsychological tests.

Their novel graph-theoretical method distinguishes genuine from spurious connectivity using triangle motif analysis, solving a critical methodological problem. Connection strength decreases exponentially with anatomical distance, with analysis in 250-ms windows providing sufficient resolution for temporal integration. The mathematical framework employs phase-locking values (PLV), weighted phase-lag indices (wPLI), and modulation indices for PAC quantification.

**Criticality creates the computational platform for temporal transitions.** Kim, Mashour, and Lee (2021, *Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience*) demonstrate that brains operating near critical points generate large synchronization fluctuations enabling continuous 250-ms timescale switching between internal integration and external processing modes. Using EEG across consciousness states (wakefulness, isoflurane/ketamine anesthesia, psychedelics, MCS, UWS; n=134 total), they show **loss of criticality disrupts temporal integration**. Their power-law analysis of dwell-time distributions, network susceptibility measures (χ), and symbolic mutual information (SMI) reveal that discrete neural avalanches at criticality create smooth conscious flow through rapid state transitions at sub-second timescales.

Levenstein et al. (2022, *PNAS*) confirm consciousness operates at edge-of-chaos critical points using modified 0-1 chaos tests on human/macaque ECoG and MEG. Unconscious states (anesthesia, seizures) transition away from criticality into either chaotic (unstable) or periodic (hyperstable) phases, both disrupting information processing. **Information preservation requires remaining at the critical point during phase transitions**—departures lose information integration capacity and conscious content.

**Multi-scale hierarchical temporal frameworks** reconcile discrete and continuous models. Narayanan, Mudrik, and Fekete (2021, *Neuroscience of Consciousness*) propose nested oscillatory levels: fast-updating gamma (40-100 Hz) for discrete perceptual snapshots, intermediate theta (2-4 Hz, 300-500ms) for the specious present, and slow infraslow oscillations for extended consciousness. The intermediate level creates phenomenal continuity through overlapping temporal windows, while fast-level discrete updates are embedded in slower continuous rhythms. Their framework employs six types of cross-frequency coupling (phase-phase, phase-amplitude, amplitude-amplitude, frequency-phase, amplitude-frequency, frequency-frequency) to multiplex information across scales.

### The specious present: 2-3 second integration windows

**Universal temporal integration mechanisms** operate at the ~3-second timescale across modalities. Multiple converging lines of evidence establish this as the core "specious present" window:

Zhao et al. (2024, *PsyCh Journal*) demonstrate a "temporal transition zone" where duration reproduction increases gradually up to 3 seconds, then plateaus at 4-5 seconds, independent of stimulus features. This supports the 3-second window as a pre-semantic logistic platform for subjective present experience.

Akyürek (2025, *Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews*)—published February 2025 as the most recent comprehensive synthesis—proposes **temporal integration as a ubiquitous adaptive process** across three nested timescales: <250ms for detection/discrimination, 0.5 to few seconds for attentional episodes, and multiple seconds to minutes for conceptual events. The framework argues temporal integration is a continuous process maximizing useful information at minimal costs, linking iconic memory, attentional blink, visual persistence, event perception, and working memory into a unified account.

**Two-stage models reconcile continuous and discrete processing.** Menétrey, Herzog, and Pascucci (2024, *bioRxiv*) provide EEG evidence that postdictive effects reveal discrete conscious perception preceded by ~450ms of unconscious integration. Sequential Metacontrast Paradigm studies show two distinct stages: early occipital processing (~200ms) for unconscious feature binding, then later centro-parietal activity (~400-600ms) marking discrete conscious percept formation. Vogelsang, Drissi-Daoudi, and Herzog (2024, *Journal of Vision*) demonstrate these **unconscious integration windows are remarkably robust** and difficult to disrupt, with offsets separated by <450ms integrating before reaching consciousness.

The landmark **Nature 2025 adversarial collaboration** (256 participants, multimodal fMRI/MEG/intracranial EEG) tested IIT versus GNWT predictions for temporal maintenance. Examining stimulus durations of 0.5-1.5 seconds, researchers found **sustained responses in occipital/temporal cortex tracking duration** rather than discrete ignition patterns, challenging both theories' temporal predictions. Content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas persisted throughout presentations, suggesting continuous maintenance mechanisms operating alongside discrete state transitions.

### Working memory and temporal chunking: seconds to minutes

**Adaptive chunking mechanisms** explain capacity limits and temporal organization. Soni and Frank (2024/2025, *eLife*) present a prefrontal-basal ganglia computational model demonstrating that **working memory capacity limits arise from learning challenges, not just storage constraints**. Their PBWM (Prefrontal-Basal Ganglia Working Memory) framework with reinforcement learning shows adaptive chunking strategies improve effective WM capacity by allowing prefrontal cortex to reuse neural populations for multiple items. This creates a quantity-precision tradeoff requiring dynamic dopaminergic signals for adaptive gating policies, explaining WM deficits in Parkinson's, ADHD, and schizophrenia.

**Critical temporal dynamics for WM maintenance** emerge from oscillatory state transitions. A Nature Communications 2025 paper demonstrates theta and alpha oscillations balance flexibility (encoding) versus stability (maintenance), with encoding states showing posterior theta and maintenance states showing dorsal alpha. Optimal transitioning between states correlates with cognitive performance, implemented through phase-amplitude coupling in biologically realistic spiking models.

## Information persistence mechanisms through phase transitions

The central question—how does information survive state changes?—receives multiple converging answers across scales.

### Synaptic reconfiguration and attractor dynamics

**Memory consolidation during sleep** provides the canonical example of information persistence through state transitions. Klinzing, Niethard, and Born (2019, *Nature Neuroscience*) establish that hippocampal replay during slow-wave sleep drives gradual transformation of representations in neocortical networks. **Three mechanisms preserve information**: hippocampal replay capturing episodic aspects, brain oscillations (slow oscillations, spindles, ripples) regulating information flow, and qualitative transformations creating abstracted gist-like representations. Information persists through "active systems consolidation" embedded in global synaptic downscaling—a dimensional reduction preserving content identity while compressing detailed episodic representations into semantic knowledge.

Wei et al. (2016, *Journal of Neuroscience*) provide mechanistic detail using detailed Hodgkin-Huxley thalamocortical models. **Spatiotemporal patterns of Up-state propagation** during sleep slow oscillations determine synaptic strength changes through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP: Δw = A+ exp(-Δt/τ+) for Δt > 0). External input mimicking hippocampal ripples creates input-specific weight changes persisting after stimulation removal. The mutual interaction between synaptic modifications and oscillation patterns creates **stable attractor states** maintaining memory traces through state transitions.

**Attractor networks** provide general frameworks for information persistence. Chaudhuri and Fiete (2022, *Nature Reviews Neuroscience*) synthesize evidence that persistent neural activity maintains information in attractor states across working memory delays. Point attractors encode discrete memories, line attractors represent continuous variables (e.g., head direction), and ring attractors handle circular variables. **Information persists through recurrent dynamics** despite noise, with attractor switching preserving task-relevant information during computational mode transitions. Empirical validation spans hippocampal place cells, entorhinal grid cells, and prefrontal working memory neurons.

Rajan et al. (2016, *PLOS Computational Biology*) extend this framework with **transient attractors** for short-term memory. Information storage occurs in time-varying synaptic strengths (not just neural activity), with transient connectivity modifications decaying on the same timescale as memories. This creates flexible storage where any pattern can be learned and multiple patterns stored simultaneously, demonstrating **content preservation through temporal bifurcations** where the attractor itself dynamically changes.

### Geometric invariants and manifold structure

**Information geometry** provides mathematical rigor for understanding information persistence through dimensional changes. Oizumi, Tsuchiya, and Amari (2016, *PNAS*) formalize integrated information (Φ) as geodesic distance in probability space using information geometry—the branch of mathematics treating information spaces as geometric manifolds. Consciousness visualizes as geometrical patterns shifting over time, with **manifold structure encoding neural state space**. Distance measures employ Kullback-Leibler divergence, Fisher information metrics, and geodesics defining optimal information integration paths. This framework enables "consciousness meters" for anesthesia monitoring and locked-in patient assessment.

Durstewitz et al. (2024, *Nature Methods*) present MARBLE (geometric deep learning for neural population dynamics), directly addressing **how information persists through manifold transitions and Hopf bifurcations**. Neural dynamics embed in low-dimensional manifolds where **invariant geometric structures persist across conditions**. Topological features (loops, tori) provide invariant descriptions surviving dimensional changes. Their framework uses spectral entropy of manifolds, von Neumann entropy for network states, and dynamical systems embedding metrics to identify conserved geometric structures. Applied to multi-session recordings and cross-animal comparisons, MARBLE demonstrates that **bifurcation parameters can be recovered from neural trajectories**, with dynamical motifs conserved across network instantiations.

Anselmi, Patel, and Rosasco (2020, *Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience*) show **object identity persists through dimensional transformations** via hierarchical simple-complex cell cascades. Alternating selectivity (feature detection) and invariance (integration) layers preserve object identity across nuisance transformations (position, pose, scale) using group-theoretic frameworks. Hebbian learning rules create invariant representations for finite orthogonal groups, demonstrating content preservation through representational space changes.

### Criticality and information integration

**Operating at critical points** enables information preservation during transitions. Shine et al. (2019, *PLOS Computational Biology*) demonstrate **gain-mediated phase transitions** between segregated and integrated brain states. Subcritical (segregated) regimes favor information storage measured by active information storage, while supercritical (integrated) regimes support information transfer quantified by transfer entropy. Operating near the critical regime provides computational flexibility, with **neural gain parameters controlling information flow** during bifurcations. Phase synchrony shifts at critical transition points, with neuromodulation (especially noradrenergic) controlling integration-segregation balance.

Baglivo et al. (2024, *Scientific Reports*) apply integrated information theory to consciousness transitions during epilepsy using SEEG recordings (6 patients, 26 seizures). **ΦAR (modified integrated information) changes correlate with consciousness state transitions**, with information integration disrupted during seizures. Non-epileptogenic regions show integration patterns corresponding to consciousness level. This demonstrates that **information persistence (consciousness) depends on integration across dimensions**—phase transitions in consciousness reflect changes in dimensional integration of information.

## Predictive processing bridges temporal gaps

**Forward models and temporal prediction** create continuity across discrete processing moments through multiple converging mechanisms.

### Neural transmission delay compensation

**Predictive coding must involve temporal forecasting** to function in real-time. Lochmann and Deneve (2019, *eNeuro*) provide the definitive demonstration that neural transmission delays (~50-100ms) require forward and backward temporal extrapolation using velocity information at each hierarchical level. Their extended hierarchical predictive coding model with Kalman filtering shows **all hierarchical levels represent moving objects at the same temporal moment** despite asynchronous processing, compensating for delays through local prediction mechanisms.

This solves the temporal binding problem through automatic real-time alignment, explaining motion-induced visual illusions (flash-lag effect, Fröhlich effect, flash-grab illusion) as prediction mechanisms. The mathematical framework employs Taylor expansion for temporal extrapolation with Hebbian learning rules for calibration. **Local circuits automatically self-calibrate to delays through prediction error minimization**—no central timing mechanism required. Temporal coherence emerges from distributed local predictions creating synchronous conscious experience from asynchronous processing.

### Hierarchical temporal depth

**Temporal depth of generative models** determines richness of conscious experience. Wiese (2017, *Philosophy and Predictive Processing*) extends Grush's Trajectory Estimation Model to hierarchical predictive processing, proposing **three types of temporal estimates**: a priori (predicted), sensory, and a posteriori (filtered). Kalman filtering combines predictions with sensory input across a hierarchy of temporal wholes at nested temporal scales. Each level represents sequences at different temporal granularities, with the **"specious present" extending through hierarchical integration**. Temporal gist at higher levels captures longer-duration patterns, while lower levels provide fine temporal resolution. Continuity arises from overlapping temporal windows across levels creating extended "living present" through retentional and protentional structure.

Safron (2020, *Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence*) synthesizes IIT, Global Neuronal Workspace Theory, and Free Energy Principle into Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT), emphasizing **temporal and counterfactual depth as essential for consciousness**. Self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs) as synchronous complexes implement turbo coding through loopy message-passing over predictive networks. Alpha-frequency SOHMs provide basic awareness, while theta-frequency phase coupling enables access consciousness. Multi-scale temporal binding through nested oscillations creates integrative world models spanning multiple timescales with spatial, temporal, and causal coherence as consciousness requirements.

### Self-evidencing and temporal persistence

**Self-reference through prediction** maintains temporal continuity of identity. Hohwy and Seth (2020, *Philosophy and the Mind Sciences*) establish predictive processing as systematic basis for identifying neural correlates of consciousness. **Predictions maintain stable perceptual representations over time** by minimizing temporal prediction errors through hierarchical loops. The system maintains coherent models of itself over time through predictive loops implementing self-evidencing. Temporal depth emerges from hierarchical integration, with precision-weighted prediction errors determining conscious content.

Luczak, McNaughton, and Kubo (2022, *Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience*) propose **neuronal adaptation as prediction mechanism** at the cellular level. Neurons predict their own future activity through predictive learning rules (Δw ∝ x(y - ŷ)), with adaptation creating temporal stability in representations. This implements predictive coding at the fundamental neural level, eliminating temporal redundancy. Anesthesia studies show loss of predictive dynamics accompanies unconsciousness, suggesting **consciousness emerges from predictive adaptation** creating temporal persistence through prediction-based stability.

Huang and Chao (2023, *PLOS Computational Biology*) develop temporal predictive coding (tPC) networks for sequential prediction, showing **hidden temporal predictions bridge discrete moments**. State trajectories represented across time enable smoothing of estimates across temporal sequences, integrating unconditional and conditional temporal statistics. EEG source analysis reveals posterior cingulate cortex integration of temporal predictions, with **neural tracking of temporal expectations** creating continuity.

## Continuous versus discrete consciousness: resolving the paradox

The 1,500-year debate initiated by Saint Augustine continues with sophisticated new frameworks synthesizing opposing positions.

### Two-stage hybrid models

**Herzog, Drissi-Daoudi, and Doerig (2020, *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*)** propose the dominant emerging framework: **discrete conscious percepts preceded by substantial continuous unconscious processing** (hundreds of milliseconds). This solves the "too-many-percepts problem" of pure continuous models and the "multiple temporal resolutions problem" of traditional discrete models. Consciousness appears continuous but consists of discrete snapshots—like cinema—with continuous processing happening unconsciously. Postdictive effects (later events determining perception of earlier events) provide empirical support, requiring high-capacity unconscious buffers. The framework uses sliding windows for unconscious processing integration, with Sequential Metacontrast paradigms validating predictions.

Yurchenko (2022, *Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience*) formalizes stream of consciousness as **discrete chain of momentary states triggered from arousal centers**. Brain dynamics are continuous at the causal level, consciousness discrete at the phenomenal level. **Consciousness emerges at critical points of phase transitions** in brain dynamics, with the illusion of temporal continuity explained by consciousness's self-evidential nature. The mathematical framework employs self-organized criticality and entropy-based complexity measures within Cognitive Evolution Theory, explicitly addressing the continuous/discrete dichotomy.

### Hierarchical multi-scale frameworks

The **nested hierarchical model** (2021, *Neuroscience of Consciousness*) combines three timescales: fast-updating (<100ms, cinematic model), intermediate (100-300ms, extensional model with modality-specific content), and slow-updating (>300ms, retentional model, conceptual). **Temporal mirroring** between levels creates structure-matching, with multiplexed connections enabling level-to-level constraints. Phenomenal experience ties primarily to the intermediate level, with fast levels providing temporal grain and slow levels providing conceptual continuity. Integration creates unified temporal experience reconciling cinematic, extensional, and retentional philosophical models.

Riddle and Schooler (2024, *Neuroscience of Consciousness*) present the **Nested Observer Windows model** with consciousness operating through hierarchical temporal integration at three levels: functional moment (~milliseconds), experienced moment (~2-3 seconds), and mental presence (multiple seconds). **Prefrontal cortex maintains temporal integrity**; disruption causes "strobing" consciousness. The model explains how brains create temporal continuity from discrete processing cycles, addressing the "continuity problem" while linking temporal binding to narrative self and memory integration.

### Quantum frameworks for temporal emergence

**Temporal Superposition and Collapse (TSC) model** (2025, OSF Preprint) proposes **time itself emergent from quantum observation**. Quantum systems exist in superposition of temporal positions (not just spatial), with temporal wavefunctions collapsing into experienced "now." Time becomes not a continuous dimension but discrete emergent moments physically real as consequences of collapse. The framework uses modified Schrödinger equations with temporal superposition and collapse terms linking consciousness to time emergence, connecting to delayed-choice quantum eraser experiments.

Edwards (2025, *Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience*) integrates predictive coding, QBism, and quantum observation in the **N-Frame model**, where consciousness actively participates in wavefunction collapse. Observers actualize quantum information (qubits) into definite states through self-referential loop structures. Quantum superposition contains temporal possibilities; observation collapses temporal wavefunctions into "now," with consciousness shaping informational substrate.

### Holographic and dimensional emergence theories

**Awret (2022, *Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience*)** proposes radical **Strange Metal Theory**: consciousness inhabits Anti-de Sitter (AdS) "bulk" spaces dual to Conformal Field Theory (CFT) brain states via AdS-CFT correspondence. A 2D or 3D quantum field theory in the brain (CFT) is dual to a 3D or 4D "bulk" space where consciousness unfolds. The extra dimension emerges from renormalization flow, with geometric space created by scaling in CFT.

This solves two major problems: (1) **Structural Mismatch Problem**—necessary connections between brain structure and phenomenal content are hidden by holographic transformation (like Gabor transforms for optical holograms); (2) **~P Problem**—consciousness seems non-physical because bulk space is real but not identical to lab space of brain. **Holographic computation transforms hard quantum information into easy classical information**, providing geometric structure for phenomenal space. The claustrum is proposed as candidate 2D CFT system, with testable predictions about strange metal dynamics and transport properties in neural tissue.

## Critical gaps and unresolved questions

Despite substantial progress, major theoretical and empirical challenges remain:

**The 300ms-3s gap**: Kent and Wittmann (2021, *Neuroscience of Consciousness*) identify that **most consciousness theories (IIT, GNWT, RPT) focus on sub-300ms processes** explaining momentary simultaneity experiences but failing to address 300ms-3s intervals necessary for experiences of change and succession. This represents a critical blind spot in major theories.

**Temporal resolution variability**: White (2018, *Consciousness and Cognition*) critiques discrete frames hypotheses, noting proposed durations range from 4.5ms to 200ms with no consensus. EEG periodicity doesn't necessarily reflect perceptual frames, and temporal properties of perception show flexibility inconsistent with rigid frame boundaries. This definitional problem plagues the field.

**Theory fragmentation**: Mudrik et al. (2025, *Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews*) report from systematic theory comparison that **more disagreement than agreement exists** on fundamental questions (what consciousness is, how to identify it). Theories may address different aspects rather than the same phenomenon, with no unified framework likely without better boundary conditions.

**Quantum decoherence problem**: While quantum consciousness theories gain mathematical sophistication, whether quantum coherence survives at brain temperatures remains controversial. Recent evidence for quantum biology and microtubule resonances provides some support, but critics argue decoherence timescales are too short.

**Clinical translation gap**: While temporal disruption markers show promise (Xu et al., 2025, *Communications Biology* change-response for coma assessment; Wehrman et al., 2024 anesthesia temporal perception review), systematic clinical validation remains incomplete.

## Implications for dimensional bifurcation theories

This literature provides robust foundations for Paper 3 on Information Persistence through Dimensional Bifurcation:

**Information conservation principles**: (1) Invariant structures (geometric, topological, attractors) preserve information through dimensional changes; (2) Critical point dynamics necessary for information preservation during transitions; (3) Synaptic/connectivity reorganization provides substrate for persistent encoding; (4) Hierarchical processing enables compression without information loss; (5) Temporal dynamics (oscillations, replay) coordinate persistence across scales.

**Testable predictions**: (1) Information-theoretic measures should remain constant through bifurcations despite dimensional changes; (2) Attractor manifolds should preserve information capacity through state transitions; (3) Neural gain/criticality modulation should control information flow during bifurcations; (4) Synaptic plasticity mechanisms should stabilize persistent information patterns; (5) Geometric invariants should predict successful information preservation.

**Convergent mechanisms**: Information persists not in static patterns but in **dynamical, geometric, and topological invariants** surviving dimensional transformations. This synthesis of dynamical systems theory, information theory, statistical physics, and network topology provides rigorous mathematical foundations for understanding how conscious content persists through phase transitions while dimensional structure changes.

The field has moved decisively beyond simple continuous-versus-discrete debates toward sophisticated hierarchical models where temporal continuity emerges from nested discrete processes operating at criticality, coordinated by predictive processing, and preserving information through geometric invariants during dimensional transitions. This represents a paradigm shift with profound implications for consciousness science, clinical neurology, and theoretical physics.
