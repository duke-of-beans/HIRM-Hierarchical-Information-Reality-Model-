## ADDRESSING THE DISCREPANCY

### "64 Papers" vs. 56 Actual Papers

**Doc1 Title Claims:** "64 Papers Addressing Critical Gaps"  
**Actual Extracted Papers:** 42 papers with complete citations

**Explanation:**
1. **Narrative Style:** Doc1 is written as a literature review with embedded citations rather than a formal reference list
2. **Multiple Mentions:** Some papers are referenced multiple times in different contexts
3. **Background References:** Some citations are to background work that supports claims but aren't fully detailed
4. **Incomplete Information:** Some papers mentioned lack complete bibliographic information (no DOI, volume, etc.)

**Previous Attempt Findings:** The earlier chat attempt correctly identified this discrepancy, extracting 43 papers from Doc1 before running out of resources

**Current Approach:** Systematic manual extraction of ALL papers with complete, citable information = **42 papers from Doc1**
