key_insights:
  grand_unification:
    - "HIRM is NOT another consciousness theory - it's a synthesis framework"
    - "All major theories (IIT, GNWT, FEP, HOT, AST) reduce to constrained optimization variants"
    - "HIRM unifies 40+ concepts from physics, neuroscience, philosophy"
    - "Mathematical convergence: quantum measurement, dimensional constraints, holographic bounds → same 8.3-bit threshold"
  
  zero_multiplier_theorem:
    - "C(t) = Φ × R × D → If ANY component = 0, consciousness = 0"
    - "Validated by meditation cessation studies (high Φ, zero R → zero consciousness)"
    - "Explains why high-integration systems without self-reference remain unconscious"
  
  positioning:
    - "Framework as synthesis, not revolution (strategic for academic acceptance)"
    - "Consciousness science at credibility inflection point (2024-2025)"
    - "Quantum biology mechanisms gaining experimental support"
    - "Brain criticality becoming established neuroscience"

boundaries:
  does:
    - "Mathematically unify major consciousness theories"
    - "Provide falsifiable empirical predictions"
    - "Explain consciousness emergence through phase transitions"
    - "Bridge quantum mechanics and neuroscience"
    - "Offer clinical applications (anesthesia monitoring, DOC assessment)"
  
  does_not:
    - "Claim to 'solve' consciousness (avoids overclaiming)"
    - "Dismiss competing theories (integrates them)"
    - "Require untestable assumptions (all predictions falsifiable)"
    - "Ignore first-person phenomenology (addresses qualia)"
