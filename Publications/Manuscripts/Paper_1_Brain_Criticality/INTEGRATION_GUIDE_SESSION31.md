## QUALITY CHECKS REQUIRED

After integration:
1. [ ] Verify section numbering consistency
2. [ ] Check cross-references still valid
3. [ ] Ensure no duplicate content
4. [ ] Validate terminology (locked_constants.md)
5. [ ] Confirm citations complete
6. [ ] Run word count verification
7. [ ] Check formatting consistency

## ALTERNATIVE: CREATE NEW UNIFIED FILE

Given document size (2,494 lines), recommend creating:
- PAPER_1_COMPREHENSIVE_V2.md
- Full integration of all content
- Clean section structure
- Ready for submission formatting

Would you prefer:
A) Detailed insertion at specific line numbers
B) Create new unified comprehensive file
C) Create section-by-section expansion files

---

## NEXT STEP RECOMMENDATION

**Option B (Recommended):** Create new unified file
- Cleaner workflow
- Easier quality control
- Preserves original as backup
- Can compare before/after

Shall I proceed with creating PAPER_1_COMPREHENSIVE_V2.md with all expansions integrated?
