## 5. Why Criticality Matters for Consciousness

### 5.1 Optimal Information Processing at Edge of Chaos

Criticality provides computational advantages essential for conscious experience:

**Maximized Dynamic Range:**
Kinouchi & Copelli (2006) proved critical networks have maximal dynamic range - the ability to respond distinctly to inputs spanning many orders of magnitude. At criticality:
- Weak signals are amplified (sensitive detection)
- Strong signals don't saturate (preserved discrimination)
- Range spans ~6-8 orders of magnitude vs. ~2 for subcritical networks

**Maximized Information Transmission:**
Shew et al. (2011) demonstrated information transmission peaks at criticality:
- Mutual information between input and output maximized
- Neither too much noise (supercritical) nor too much attenuation (subcritical)
- Optimal signal-to-noise ratio for internal communication

**Maximized Information Storage:**
Haldeman & Beggs (2005) showed memory capacity peaks at criticality:
- Critical networks store more distinct patterns
- Retrieval is more reliable
- Pattern completion is optimized

### 5.2 The Integration-Segregation Balance

Conscious experience requires both:
- **Integration:** Unified experience across modalities
- **Segregation:** Distinct processing of different information streams

Criticality uniquely enables this balance:

**Subcritical (segregated):**
- Activity remains local
- Modules operate independently
- No unified experience

**Supercritical (integrated but chaotic):**
- Activity spreads everywhere
- All modules conflate
- No distinct content

**Critical (balanced):**
- Activity can spread globally OR remain local
- Flexible switching between modes
- Integration when needed, segregation when needed

This "metastability" - the ability to visit multiple configurations - characterizes conscious brain dynamics. Criticality provides the dynamical repertoire for rich conscious content.

### 5.3 Criticality Enables But Does Not Constitute Consciousness

Here we confront a crucial distinction. Criticality is necessary but not sufficient for consciousness. Evidence for insufficiency:

**In Vitro Preparations:**
Cortical slices and cultures show power-law avalanches without any plausible consciousness. Criticality emerges from network dynamics independent of conscious experience.

**Ketamine Paradox (Resolved):**
Ketamine preserves criticality and consciousness while eliminating behavioral responsiveness. This supports criticality as necessary - both are preserved together. But what explains why criticality supports consciousness?

**DMT Paradox:**
Irrmischer et al. (2025) found DMT shifts dynamics toward subcritical despite intensified consciousness. However, this may reflect measurement limitations - DMT states may involve altered criticality rather than absent criticality.

**The Sufficiency Gap:**
If criticality alone were sufficient, any critical system would be conscious - including sandpiles, forest fires, and computer networks tuned to criticality. This reductio ad absurdum shows additional factors must be involved.

### 5.4 What's Missing? The Self-Reference Gap

HIRM proposes the missing factor is **self-referential information processing**. Criticality is necessary because:

1. Only at criticality can information integrate globally (Phi maximized)
2. Only at criticality can self-referential loops close completely (R -> 1)
3. Only at criticality do fluctuations enable phase transitions (SRID trigger)

But criticality is insufficient because:

4. Self-reference completion (R -> 1) requires specific architecture
5. Dimensional complexity (D) requires sufficient degrees of freedom
6. The multiplicative threshold C = Phi x R x D > C_critical requires all factors

The next section develops how HIRM addresses this sufficiency gap.
