- Add more psychedelic studies with quantitative data

### Priority 2: Clinical Applications (Section 7)
- Expand anesthesia monitoring with protocol details
- Add DOC assessment protocols with case examples
- Include sensitivity/specificity for each measure
- Add implementation considerations for clinical settings

### Priority 3: Theoretical Foundations (Section 2)
- Expand Ising model mathematics with derivations
- Add percolation theory formal treatment
- Include more bifurcation dynamics
- Add mathematical connections between frameworks

### Priority 4: HIRM Framework (Section 6)
- Expand six convergent paths with full derivations
- Add mathematical formalism for each component
- Include computational tractability discussion
- Add comparison with competing frameworks

### Priority 5: Why Criticality Matters (Section 5)
- Expand zero-multiplier validation with more evidence

## QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

- Every study cited must include: authors, year, N, key finding
- Effect sizes where available (Cohen's d, r, eta-squared)
- Falsification criteria for all claims
- Explicit acknowledgment of limitations
- No "Ouroboros Observer" terminology
- Constants match locked_constants.md
