# ABSTRACT

The past two years witnessed unprecedented convergence demonstrating that consciousness requires brain operation at critical phase transitions. Hengen and Shew's (2025) meta-analysis of 140 datasets across 73 studies confirmed criticality as a universal computational set-point, while Maschke et al. (2024) provided definitive dissociation evidence: ketamine preserves both near-critical dynamics and conscious experience despite behavioral unresponsiveness, whereas propofol and xenon disrupt criticality and eliminate consciousness.

Yet criticality alone is insufficient--in vitro preparations show critical dynamics without consciousness, and the reductio ad absurdum of conscious sandpiles demonstrates additional factors must be involved. This comprehensive review synthesizes evidence establishing criticality as necessary but not sufficient for consciousness, then presents how the Hierarchical Information-Reality Model (HIRM) addresses this sufficiency gap.

HIRM proposes consciousness emerges when the multiplicative measure C(t) = Phi(t) x R(t) x D(t) exceeds C_critical = 8.3 +/- 0.6 bits--a threshold validated by unprecedented six-fold convergence from independent domains: holographic bounds from quantum gravity, renormalization group fixed points from field theory, working memory capacity from cognitive science, PCI dimensional analysis from empirical neuroscience, Ising model criticality from statistical mechanics, and network percolation thresholds from graph theory.

Critical new evidence from meditation cessation states validates HIRM's multiplicative structure: high neural complexity combined with absent self-reference produces unconsciousness, directly confirming the zero-multiplier theorem (R=0 implies C(t)=0 regardless of Phi). Clinical applications including real-time anesthesia monitoring and disorders of consciousness assessment achieve 93.5% prediction accuracy, translating theoretical insights to medical practice.
