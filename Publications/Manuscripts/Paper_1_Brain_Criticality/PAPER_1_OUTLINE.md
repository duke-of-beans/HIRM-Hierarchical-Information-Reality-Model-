## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS FROM EXISTING REVIEWS

1. **Integration with HIRM** - Not just "criticality correlates with consciousness" but explains WHY through self-reference mechanism
2. **2024-2025 Evidence** - Includes Hengen & Shew meta-analysis, COGITATE results, Maschke ketamine dissociation
3. **Sufficiency Analysis** - Addresses why criticality alone is insufficient (ketamine, in vitro preparations)
4. **Clinical Translation** - Practical applications with quantitative predictions
5. **Mathematical Rigor** - Links to bifurcation theory, RG, information geometry
