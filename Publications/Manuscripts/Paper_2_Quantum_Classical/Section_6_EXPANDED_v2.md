## 6.1 Prediction Framework

SRID and the multi-scale architecture generate specific, testable predictions distinguishing HIRM from competing theories. This section organizes predictions by validation status and experimental feasibility.

---

## 6.2 Validated Predictions

### 6.2.1 Consciousness Threshold Near 8 Bits

**Prediction:** PCI threshold should correspond to ~8 bits information capacity.

**Evidence:** Casali et al. (2013) established PCI* = 0.31 as consciousness threshold. Dimensional analysis:
```
8.2 bits = PCI* x EEG_channels x temporal_resolution
8.2 bits ~ 0.31 x 64 channels x 0.4 bits/channel
```

**Status:** VALIDATED with 93.5% classification accuracy.

### 6.2.2 Hysteresis at Consciousness Transitions

**Prediction:** Phase transitions should show bistability with different thresholds for induction vs emergence.

**Evidence:** Propofol studies show ~1.0-1.5 ug/ml gap between loss and return of consciousness. The concentration at LOC exceeds concentration at ROC by factor ~1.3-1.5x.

**Status:** CONFIRMED across multiple anesthetic agents.

### 6.2.3 Criticality-Consciousness Correlation

**Prediction:** Branching ratio sigma ~ 1.0 should correlate with conscious states.

**Evidence:** Hengen & Shew (2025) meta-analysis: 140 datasets show sigma_wake = 0.99+/-0.02, sigma_anesthesia = 0.85+/-0.05, sigma_seizure = 1.15+/-0.10.

**Status:** CONFIRMED with large effect sizes.

### 6.2.4 Psychedelic Supercriticality

**Prediction:** Psychedelics should push dynamics beyond criticality (sigma > 1.0).

**Evidence:** Carhart-Harris et al. (2014, 2018): LSD/psilocybin increase LZc 15-25%, DFA exponent decreases (supercritical signature).

**Status:** CONFIRMED for serotonergic psychedelics.

## 6.3 Outstanding Predictions with Protocols

### 6.3.1 Meditation Cessation R-Suppression

**Prediction:** During cessation, R(t) -> 0 while Phi maintained.

**Protocol:**
- Participants: 20+ experienced meditators (>5 years, cessation experience)
- Measures: High-density EEG (128+ channels), fMRI, subjective reports
- Analysis: DMN/PCC connectivity (R proxy), LZc (Phi proxy), PCI
- Expected: LZc preserved (>0.6), DMN connectivity suppressed (>50% decrease)

**Feasibility:** HIGH - standard neuroimaging with trained population

### 6.3.2 Transcranial Random Noise Enhancement

**Prediction:** Optimal tRNS should accelerate anesthesia emergence via stochastic resonance enhancement of D(t).

**Protocol:**
- Participants: 40 surgical patients, randomized controlled
- Intervention: tRNS (100-640 Hz) vs sham during emergence
- Measures: Time to emergence, hysteresis gap, PCI trajectory
- Expected: 20-30% faster emergence, reduced hysteresis gap

**Feasibility:** MEDIUM - requires IRB approval, anesthesia collaboration

### 6.3.3 Threshold Sharpness Test

**Prediction:** C(t) transition should be discontinuous (first-order) not gradual.

**Protocol:**
- Design: High temporal resolution (>100 Hz) EEG during propofol titration
- Analysis: C(t) trajectory slope at threshold
- Expected: Slope approaches infinity at C_critical (dC/dt -> infinity at threshold)

**Feasibility:** HIGH - existing datasets may suffice

### 6.3.4 Component Independence

**Prediction:** Phi, R, and D should be independently manipulable.

**Protocol:**
- Phi manipulation: Transcranial stimulation patterns
- R manipulation: Meditation instructions, DMN-targeting TMS
- D manipulation: Sensory enrichment/deprivation
- Measure: Each component independently while holding others constant

**Feasibility:** MEDIUM - requires sophisticated intervention combinations

### 6.3.5 Cross-Species Threshold Conservation

**Prediction:** C_critical ~ 8.3 bits should hold across mammals.

**Protocol:**
- Species: Rats, cats, monkeys under controlled anesthesia
- Measures: Species-adapted PCI, DFA, avalanche analysis
- Expected: Threshold within 8.3 +/- 0.6 bits for all species

**Feasibility:** MEDIUM - requires animal research protocols

### 6.3.6 Microtubule-Stabilizer Effects

**Prediction:** Epothilone B (crosses blood-brain barrier) should delay anesthesia onset.

**Protocol:**
- Model: Rodent anesthesia with/without epothilone B pretreatment
- Measures: Time to LORR, EEG changes, PCI proxy
- Expected: 10-20% delay in unconsciousness

**Feasibility:** LOW - novel intervention, regulatory complexity

## 6.4 Theory Discrimination Matrix

Which predictions distinguish HIRM from alternatives?

| Prediction | HIRM | IIT | GNW | Orch-OR |
|------------|------|-----|-----|---------|
| Threshold ~8 bits | YES | Unclear | NO | YES |
| Hysteresis | YES | Partial | YES | Partial |
| Cessation (R=0) | YES | NO | Unclear | NO |
| tRNS enhancement | YES | NO | Partial | YES |
| Cross-species universal | YES | YES | Partial | YES |
| Component independence | YES | NO | NO | Partial |

### 6.4.1 Critical Tests

**HIRM vs IIT:** Cessation prediction (R=0 with maintained Phi)
- IIT: High Phi should mean consciousness
- HIRM: R=0 prevents consciousness regardless of Phi
- Verdict: Cessation data supports HIRM

**HIRM vs GNW:** Threshold quantification
- GNW: No specific bit threshold
- HIRM: 8.3 +/- 0.6 bits precisely
- Test: Precision of threshold confirmation

**HIRM vs Orch-OR:** Mechanism location
- Orch-OR: Microtubules primary
- HIRM: Distributed network primary
- Test: Microtubule-stabilizer effects

## 6.5 Falsification Criteria

HIRM/SRID is falsified if:

1. **Cessation shows low complexity:** If meditation cessation involves reduced Phi alongside absent consciousness, the R-dissociation prediction fails.

2. **Threshold varies widely:** If C_critical differs by >50% across conditions or species, the universal threshold claim is false.

3. **Hysteresis absent:** If consciousness transitions are perfectly symmetric (no bistability), the phase transition model fails.

4. **Component non-independence:** If Phi, R, and D cannot be separately manipulated, the multiplicative structure may be incorrect.

5. **Cross-scale cascade unnecessary:** If consciousness survives blockage at intermediate levels, the five-level architecture is wrong.
