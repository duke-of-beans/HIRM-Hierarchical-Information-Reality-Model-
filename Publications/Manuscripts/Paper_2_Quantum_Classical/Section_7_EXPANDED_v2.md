# PAPER 2 - SECTION 7: RELATIONSHIP TO COMPETING THEORIES (EXPANDED)

## 7. Relationship to Competing Theories

SRID does not seek to replace existing consciousness theories but to integrate and extend them. This section positions SRID within the theoretical landscape and identifies critical empirical tests.

### 7.1 Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

**IIT Core Claims:**
- Consciousness IS integrated information (Phi)
- Phi quantifies irreducible cause-effect structure
- Every system has some Phi (panpsychism)
- No threshold; consciousness is continuous with Phi

**SRID Relationship:**
- **Shared:** Phi as key measure of integration
- **Different:** SRID requires Phi x R x D > threshold (not Phi alone)
- **Extended:** SRID explains WHY integration matters (enables SRID)

**Critical Tests:**

*Test 1: High-Phi systems without consciousness*
- IIT: Impossible (high Phi = high consciousness)
- SRID: Possible if R < 1 (no self-reference)
- Example: Grid network with high Phi but no self-modeling capacity

*Test 2: Component dissociation*
- IIT: Components (integration, exclusion, composition) inseparable
- SRID: Components (Phi, R, D) independently manipulable
- Example: Meditation cessation shows high Phi + zero R = no consciousness

**Empirical Status:** COGITATE adversarial collaboration (2025) found IIT's predictions only partially supported. Specifically, posterior hot zone predictions were confirmed, but within-content predictions about Phi specificity were not. The explanatory gap remains for why integration produces experience.

### 7.2 Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW)

**GNW Core Claims:**
- Consciousness = global broadcasting
- Information becomes conscious when broadcast widely
- All-or-none access (threshold mechanism)
- Prefrontal-parietal network critical

**SRID Relationship:**
- **Shared:** Threshold mechanism, all-or-none character
- **Different:** Broadcasting necessary but not sufficient
- **Extended:** SRID explains WHY broadcasting creates consciousness (enables self-reference across network)

**Critical Tests:**

*Test 1: Broadcasting without consciousness*
- GNW: Impossible (broadcasting = consciousness)
- SRID: Possible if broadcast information lacks self-referential structure
- Example: Reflex arcs globally broadcast but unconscious

*Test 2: Prefrontal role*
- GNW: Prefrontal cortex necessary for consciousness
- SRID: Prefrontal cortex contributes to R factor, not solely determining
- Example: Rare prefrontal lesion patients with preserved consciousness

**Empirical Status:** GNW received strong support in COGITATE for the "ignition" pattern (sharp P3b component). However, the theory struggles to explain why broadcasting creates experience rather than merely access.

### 7.3 Higher-Order Thought (HOT) Theories

**HOT Core Claims:**
- Consciousness requires higher-order representation
- A mental state is conscious when represented by another state
- Self-reference (of a kind) is necessary
- Prefrontal cortex implements higher-order representation

**SRID Relationship:**
- **Shared:** Self-reference necessary for consciousness
- **Different:** SRID quantifies self-reference (R factor) and requires completion (R -> 1)
- **Extended:** SRID explains WHY higher-order representation matters (triggers SRID)

**Critical Tests:**

*Test 1: Degree of self-reference matters*
- HOT: Any higher-order representation sufficient
- SRID: Must approach completeness (R -> 1)
- Implication: Partial self-modeling insufficient

*Test 2: Graduality vs threshold*
- HOT: Consciousness grades with quality of higher-order representation
- SRID: Sharp threshold at R -> 1
- Test: Parametric manipulation of self-modeling capacity

### 7.4 Predictive Processing / Free Energy Principle

**FEP Core Claims:**
- Brain minimizes free energy (prediction error)
- Consciousness relates to hierarchical predictive modeling
- Self-modeling as special case of world-modeling
- Continuous with life and cognition

**SRID Relationship:**
- **Shared:** Self-modeling central to consciousness
- **Different:** SRID requires complete self-modeling triggering phase transition
- **Extended:** FEP describes optimization; SRID explains threshold

**Integration:** FEP drives system toward states minimizing prediction error. When self-model becomes sufficiently accurate (R -> 1), SRID triggers. FEP and SRID are complementary: FEP explains dynamics, SRID explains emergence.

**Critical Tests:**
- FEP: Consciousness correlates with free energy minimization
- SRID: Consciousness emerges at threshold regardless of ongoing minimization
- Test: Systems that have minimized free energy without reaching C_critical

### 7.5 Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR)

**Orch-OR Core Claims:**
- Quantum computations in microtubules
- Gravitational self-energy triggers objective collapse
- Collapse = moment of conscious experience
- Non-computable; explains human insight

**SRID Relationship:**
- **Shared:** Quantum processes in microtubules; collapse relevant
- **Different:** Collapse trigger (gravity vs. self-reference)
- **Advantage:** SRID doesn't require exotic physics; testable with current methods

**Critical Tests:**

*Test 1: Manipulate self-reference independently of mass*
- Orch-OR: Collapse depends on mass/energy
- SRID: Collapse depends on information closure
- Example: Same microtubule mass, different self-reference levels

*Test 2: Anesthetic mechanisms*
- Orch-OR: Anesthetics disrupt quantum coherence in microtubules
- SRID: Anesthetics disrupt integration and self-reference
- Test: Compare anesthetic effects on coherence vs integration

**Empirical Status:** Wiest et al. (2024) found that Epothilone B (microtubule stabilizer) delayed anesthetic-induced unconsciousness by 69 seconds (p = 0.0016). This supports microtubule involvement but doesn't distinguish Orch-OR from SRID mechanisms.

### 7.6 Attention Schema Theory (AST)

**AST Core Claims:**
- Consciousness is attention schema (model of attention)
- Brain constructs simplified model of its own attention
- Explains subjective qualities as modeled properties
- No hard problem; just modeling

**SRID Relationship:**
- **Shared:** Self-modeling central
- **Different:** SRID adds integration (Phi) and complexity (D) requirements
- **Extended:** AST describes what is modeled; SRID explains why modeling triggers emergence

### 7.7 Theory Selection Criteria

Given multiple viable theories, how should we choose? We propose:

1. **Quantitative precision:** Theories with specific numerical predictions (SRID: C_critical = 8.3 +/- 0.6 bits) are preferable to qualitative claims
2. **Falsifiability:** Theories must specify conditions under which they would be wrong
3. **Integration:** Theories that synthesize existing insights are preferable to those requiring wholesale rejection
4. **Parsimony:** Minimal new entities or exotic physics
5. **Experimental tractability:** Predictions testable with current or near-term methods

**SRID scores well:** Quantitative (C_critical derived), falsifiable (threshold predictions), integrative (unifies IIT/GNW/HOT insights), parsimonious (no new physics), and tractable (EEG, anesthesia, criticality measures).

### 7.8 Synthesis: HIRM as Meta-Framework

SRID positions within HIRM (Hierarchical Information-Reality Model) as a synthesis:

| Theory | Captures | Within HIRM |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| IIT | Integration (Phi) | CCL integration measure |
| GNW | Global broadcasting | MOL emergence mechanism |
| HOT | Self-reference (R) | Self-modeling component |
| FEP | Optimization dynamics | Drives toward C_critical |
| Orch-OR | Quantum substrate | QIL foundations |
| AST | Attention modeling | Content of R factor |

**Key Insight:** Each theory captures a necessary but insufficient component. HIRM unifies them through the multiplicative structure C = Phi x R x D, where each factor corresponds to valid theoretical insights. The zero-multiplier theorem explains why each component alone is insufficient: if any factor is zero, C = 0 regardless of others.
