## ABSTRACT DRAFT

Personal identity presents a profound puzzle: how does the sense of "being the same person" persist through sleep, anesthesia, and even near-death experiences? We propose that identity information is encoded in a Persistent Information Structure (PIS) that survives dimensional bifurcation events at C_critical. Drawing on quantum Darwinism, topological invariants, and attractor dynamics, we demonstrate that information can persist through radical state-space restructuring via geometric and quantum-mechanical invariants. Clinical evidence from disorders of consciousness, developmental trajectories showing C(t) emergence at 18-24 months coinciding with mirror self-recognition, and anesthesia recovery patterns support this framework. The model predicts that consciousness requires not just integrated information, but information structures robust to dimensional transitions.

**Keywords:** identity, temporal continuity, information persistence, phase transitions, consciousness, quantum Darwinism
