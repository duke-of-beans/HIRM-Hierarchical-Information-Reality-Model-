# PAPER 3 - SECTION 8: TESTABLE PREDICTIONS

## 8. Testable Predictions

The PIS framework generates specific, falsifiable predictions distinguishing it from alternatives.

### 8.1 Information Conservation

**Prediction 8.1:** Mutual information I(past:future) should remain constant through consciousness transitions, despite dramatic changes in CCL activity patterns.

**Test:** High-density EEG during anesthesia induction and emergence. Track mutual information between pre- and post-transition states.

**Null Hypothesis (Standard View):** I(past:future) should drop during unconsciousness.

### 8.2 Topological Discontinuity

**Prediction 8.2:** Betti number β₁ (self-referential loops) should show discontinuous increase at C_critical, then remain stable through subsequent state transitions.

**Test:** Persistent homology analysis of neural state trajectories during consciousness transitions.

**Falsification:** Continuous β₁ changes would refute threshold prediction.

### 8.3 Attractor Capacity Preservation

**Prediction 8.3:** The information capacity of attractor basins should persist through state transitions. Basin topology should be unchanged pre- and post-transition.

**Test:** Perturbation-response protocols measuring basin structure before and after sleep/anesthesia.

### 8.4 Critical Dynamics Requirement

**Prediction 8.4:** Successful identity preservation requires branching parameter σ = 1.00 ± 0.05 during transitions. Deviations from criticality should correlate with identity disruption.

**Test:** Monitor criticality markers during transitions; correlate with post-transition identity measures.

### 8.5 Geometric Invariants

**Prediction 8.5:** Fisher information metric eigenvalues should show curvature singularity at C_critical, with geodesic focusing. Geometric shape of PIS manifold should persist.

**Test:** Information-geometric analysis of neural manifolds during transitions.

### 8.6 Quantum Redundancy

**Prediction 8.6:** Redundancy measure R_δ should increase sharply at return of consciousness, preceding behavioral indicators.

**Test:** Multi-modal neuroimaging during anesthesia emergence; track redundancy before behavioral arousal.

### 8.7 Clinical Recovery Correlation

**Prediction 8.7:** PIS structural integrity (DTI connectivity, graph-theoretic global efficiency) should predict identity preservation and recovery outcomes in DOC patients.

**Test:** Prospective study correlating structural measures with functional recovery and identity assessment.

### 8.8 Developmental Trajectory

**Prediction 8.8:** C(t) should cross C_critical at 18-24 months, coinciding with mirror self-recognition emergence. EEG markers of criticality should appear at this age.

**Test:** Longitudinal infant study with EEG, behavioral assessment, and mirror task.

### 8.9 Summary Table

| # | Prediction | Test | Falsification |
|---|------------|------|---------------|
| 8.1 | I(past:future) constant | EEG mutual information | Drops during transition |
| 8.2 | β₁ discontinuous at threshold | Persistent homology | Continuous change |
| 8.3 | Basin capacity preserved | Perturbation protocols | Capacity changes |
| 8.4 | σ ≈ 1.0 required | Criticality monitoring | Works away from criticality |
| 8.5 | Geometric singularity at C_crit | Information geometry | No curvature change |
| 8.6 | Redundancy precedes arousal | Multi-modal imaging | Redundancy follows behavior |
| 8.7 | Structure predicts recovery | DTI/graph in DOC | Activity predicts better |
| 8.8 | C_critical at 18-24 months | Longitudinal infant study | Different timing |
