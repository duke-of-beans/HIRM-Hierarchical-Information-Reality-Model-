# PAPER 3 - SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM OF IDENTITY PERSISTENCE

## 1. The Problem of Identity Persistence

### 1.1 The Puzzle

Every night, you lose consciousness. Neural activity patterns reorganize dramatically. Brain states that existed moments before sleep onset no longer exist. Yet you wake as the same person - with the same memories, preferences, and sense of continuous selfhood.

This persistence presents a profound puzzle. If consciousness depends on specific neural activity patterns, and those patterns are disrupted during sleep, anesthesia, or coma, what preserves identity across the gap? How can the "you" of tomorrow be the same "you" as today when the underlying neural dynamics have been completely reorganized?

### 1.2 Philosophical Background

Philosophy has long grappled with identity persistence. The Ship of Theseus asks: if every plank is gradually replaced, is it the same ship? Locke proposed psychological continuity - memory chains linking past and present selves. Parfit argued identity might be less determinate than we assume.

These thought experiments acquire empirical urgency in modern neuroscience. We know that:
- Synaptic connections remodel continuously
- Neural activity patterns change moment to moment
- Sleep involves massive state reorganization
- Anesthesia disrupts information integration

Yet personal identity persists. This is not mere intuition but empirically demonstrable: memories formed before sleep are accessible afterward; skills learned before anesthesia remain; personality traits survive coma recovery.

### 1.3 Clinical Evidence

Clinical cases sharpen the puzzle:

**Coma Recovery:** Patients unconscious for months or years sometimes recover with identity intact. Terry Wallis regained awareness after 19 years, recognizing family members and retaining pre-injury memories. What preserved his identity during two decades of disrupted neural activity?

**Anesthesia:** General anesthesia abolishes consciousness completely, yet patients wake as the same person. This happens billions of times yearly without identity loss. Something survives the complete interruption.

**Split-Brain Patients:** Corpus callosum severing creates two independent conscious streams. Yet patients typically report a unified sense of self. The substrate of consciousness can bifurcate while identity remains (somewhat) unified.

### 1.4 Why Standard Theories Struggle

**IIT** proposes consciousness IS integrated information (Φ). But Φ varies continuously with brain state. If identity = Φ, identity should fluctuate moment to moment. It doesn't.

**GNW** identifies consciousness with global broadcasting. But broadcasting patterns change radically during sleep. If identity = broadcasting pattern, identity should change. It doesn't.

**Embodied/Enactive** approaches ground identity in body-environment coupling. But bodily states change continuously. The felt sense of "same body, same self" requires explanation.

Standard theories explain consciousness at a moment but struggle with identity across time, especially across major state transitions.

### 1.5 HIRM's Proposal: Persistent Information Structure

HIRM proposes that identity is encoded in a Persistent Information Structure (PIS) - information patterns robust to the state-space bifurcations occurring at consciousness transitions.

The PIS is not the CCL (Consciousness Computation Layer) activity that generates moment-to-moment experience. It is the *invariant structure* preserved when CCL reorganizes. Think of it like the shape of a landscape versus the path of water flowing through it: the water path changes with rain and drought, but the landscape topology persists.

Key properties of PIS:
- Encodes identity information (memories, preferences, self-model)
- Survives CCL bifurcations at C_critical
- Implemented across multiple physical scales (quantum to synaptic)
- Exhibits redundancy protecting against local damage

This paper develops the PIS concept, presenting mechanisms for information persistence, empirical evidence across clinical domains, and testable predictions distinguishing HIRM from alternatives.
