## Figure F3: Percolation-Consciousness Relationship
**Purpose:** Show network connectivity threshold

**Panel A: Network States**
```
lambda < 0.3          lambda = 0.3         lambda > 0.3
[Fragmented]    -->   [Transition]    -->  [Connected]

**Purpose:** Show how R=0 kills consciousness despite high Phi

**Three-panel comparison:**

**Panel A: Normal Conscious State**
- Phi = 12, R = 0.8, D = 1.0
- C = 9.6 bits [CONSCIOUS]

**Panel B: Meditation Cessation**
- Phi = 12, R = 0.0, D = 1.0
- C = 0 bits [UNCONSCIOUS]

**Panel C: Formula**
- C(t) = Phi(t) x R(t) x D(t)
- If R = 0: C = 0 regardless of Phi
