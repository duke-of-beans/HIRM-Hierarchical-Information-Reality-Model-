## CORE HIRM TERMINOLOGY

### Framework Name
- **Canonical:** HIRM (Hierarchical Information-Reality Model)
- **Pronunciation:** "HURM" (rhymes with "firm")
- **Never:** "H-I-R-M" (don't spell it out)

### Primary Components

| Term | Symbol | Definition | Units |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Consciousness Measure | C(t) | Total information processing capacity enabling conscious experience | bits |
| Integrated Information | Φ(t) | Irreducible information integration (IIT-inspired) | bits |
| Self-Reference | R(t) | Degree to which system models itself | dimensionless (0-1) |
| Dimensional Complexity | D(t) | Effective dimensionality of state space | effective dimensions |
| Critical Threshold | C_critical | Minimum C(t) for consciousness emergence | bits (8.3 ± 0.6) |

### Phase Transition Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Critical Point | System parameter value where phase transition occurs |
| Critical Brain Dynamics | Brain operating near criticality (edge of chaos) |
| Phase Transition | Qualitative change in system behavior |
| Order Parameter | Quantity that distinguishes phases (here: C(t)) |
| Criticality | State where system exhibits scale-free dynamics |

### Measurement Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| PCI | Perturbational Complexity Index (TMS-EEG measure) |
| DOC | Disorders of Consciousness |
| UWS | Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (formerly "vegetative") |
| MCS | Minimally Conscious State |
| LOC | Loss of Consciousness |

## COMPETING THEORY TERMINOLOGY

### How to Reference Other Theories

| Theory | Abbreviation | Lead Researcher(s) |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Integrated Information Theory | IIT | Tononi, Koch |
| Global Neuronal Workspace Theory | GNWT | Dehaene, Changeux |
| Recurrent Processing Theory | RPT | Lamme |
| Attention Schema Theory | AST | Graziano |
| Higher-Order Thought Theory | HOT | Rosenthal |
| Free Energy Principle | FEP | Friston |

**Note:** Always cite original authors when referencing competing theories.

## FORBIDDEN TERMS

| [NO] DO NOT USE | Why | [YES] USE INSTEAD |
|--------------|-----|----------------|
| "Proves consciousness" | Cannot prove, only support | "Supports the hypothesis" |
| "Quantum consciousness" (unqualified) | Implies Penrose-Hameroff | "Quantum effects in consciousness" (if applicable) |
| "The theory is correct" | Science doesn't prove, only falsify | "Evidence supports the theory" |
| "Explains consciousness" | Too strong | "Proposes mechanism for consciousness emergence" |

## CONFIDENCE QUALIFIERS

Use these to indicate certainty level:

| Qualifier | Meaning | Use When |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| ESTABLISHED | Strong evidence, multiple independent sources | Core physics, math |
| PROVISIONAL | Good evidence, needs more validation | HIRM predictions |
| SPECULATIVE | Hypothesis stage, minimal evidence | New theoretical ideas |
| DEPRECATED | Superseded by better understanding | Old versions of claims |

## UPDATE PROTOCOL

When adding new terminology:
1. Add to database: `hirm.db` terminology table
2. Update this file
3. Update any documents using the term
4. Ensure consistency across corpus
