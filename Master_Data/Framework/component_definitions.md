# HIRM COMPONENT DEFINITIONS
## Operational Definitions for Φ, R, and D
## Last Updated: 2025-12-21

## THE CONSCIOUSNESS EQUATION

```
C(t) = Φ(t) × R(t) × D(t)
```

**Critical Property:** Multiplicative structure means ANY component = 0 → C(t) = 0

## Φ(t) - INTEGRATED INFORMATION

### Definition
**Symbol:** Φ (Phi)
**Name:** Integrated Information
**Units:** bits
**Range:** 0 to ~10 bits (human brain)

### Operational Definition
Φ(t) measures the irreducible information integration of a system - information generated by the whole that cannot be reduced to information generated by its parts.

### Measurement Protocol
1. **EEG-based:** Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) proxy
2. **Computational:** IIT 3.0 algorithm on connectivity matrix
3. **Approximation:** Effective information across system partition

### Mathematical Expression
```
Φ = min_{partition} I(whole) - I(parts)
```

Where I is mutual information across the minimum information partition.

### Physical Interpretation
- High Φ: Parts are informationally interdependent
- Low Φ: System is decomposable into independent modules
- Φ = 0: No integration (e.g., disconnected components)

## R(t) - SELF-REFERENCE COEFFICIENT

### Definition
**Symbol:** R
**Name:** Self-Reference Coefficient  
**Units:** dimensionless
**Range:** 0 to 1

### Operational Definition
R(t) measures the degree to which a system's dynamics include representations of itself - the extent to which the system models its own states.

### Measurement Protocol
1. **Neural:** Prefrontal-parietal recurrent connectivity strength
2. **Computational:** Fraction of system states encoding system-level properties
3. **Behavioral:** Metacognitive accuracy on self-reports

### Mathematical Expression
```
R = || Π_self(S) || / || S ||
```

Where Π_self is the projection onto self-referential state subspace.

### Physical Interpretation
- R ≈ 1: System fully models itself (strong metacognition)
- R ≈ 0: No self-model (ant colony, cerebellum)
- Intermediate: Partial self-awareness

### THE ZERO-MULTIPLIER INSIGHT
Because C = Φ × R × D, systems with R = 0 cannot be conscious regardless of Φ:
- Ant colonies: High Φ, R = 0 → C = 0
- AI (current): High Φ, R ≈ 0 → C ≈ 0
- Cerebellum: High Φ, R ≈ 0 → C ≈ 0

## D(t) - DIMENSIONAL COMPLEXITY

### Definition
**Symbol:** D
**Name:** Dimensional Complexity
**Units:** effective dimensions
**Range:** 1 to ~7 (human brain, per Miller's 7±2)

### Operational Definition
D(t) measures the effective dimensionality of the system's state space - how many independent degrees of freedom are actively being explored.

### Measurement Protocol
1. **Neural:** Participation ratio of neural state covariance
2. **Computational:** Intrinsic dimensionality estimation
3. **Information-theoretic:** Entropy-based dimension

### Mathematical Expression
```
D = (Σ λ_i)² / Σ λ_i²
```

Where λ_i are eigenvalues of the state covariance matrix.

### Physical Interpretation
- High D: Rich, high-dimensional experience
- Low D: Constrained, stereotyped states
- D = 1: Single attractor, no exploration

### Connection to 7±2
Miller's cognitive capacity limit (7±2 items) may reflect maximum D for conscious processing.

## INTERACTION EFFECTS

### Why Multiplication, Not Addition?

**C = Φ × R × D** (not Φ + R + D) because:

1. **Missing components eliminate consciousness:**
   - High Φ + R = 0 + any D → No consciousness (ant colony)
   - Any Φ + any R + D = 0 → No consciousness (frozen system)

2. **All three are necessary, none sufficient:**
   - Φ alone: Integration without awareness
   - R alone: Self-model without content
   - D alone: Complexity without integration

3. **Phase transition requires all components:**
   - C_critical threshold only meaningful when all > 0

### Dimensional Analysis Check
```
C [bits] = Φ [bits] × R [dimensionless] × D [dimensions]
```

**Note:** This gives [bits × dimensions], not pure bits. This suggests either:
- D should be normalized differently, OR
- C should be interpreted as "bits of conscious capacity" with dimensional quality

**Status:** PROVISIONAL - dimensional analysis needs refinement

## MEASUREMENT CHALLENGES

| Component | Challenge | Current Approach |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| Φ | NP-hard to compute exactly | Use PCI proxy, approximations |
| R | No consensus definition | Neural correlates of metacognition |
| D | Multiple valid definitions | Participation ratio standard |

## UPDATE PROTOCOL

When refining component definitions:
1. Update this document
2. Update database (constants, equations tables)
3. Check all documents using the definition
4. Run quality gate validation
5. Log changes in corrections table
