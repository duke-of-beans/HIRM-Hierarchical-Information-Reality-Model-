# Consciousness at the Edge: Testing HIRM Across Non-Traditional Substrates

Current brain organoids reach 100 million cells with EEG patterns matching 25-38 week preterm infants, approaching but not exceeding the critical consciousness threshold. Plants show 28-day memory retention and sophisticated electrical signaling but **lack the integration architecture for consciousness**. Fungal networks transmit signals at 100-10,000 Hz across hectare-scale mycelium, yet operate 10³-10⁶ times slower than conscious integration. The verdict across all edge cases: **impressive intelligence without consciousness**, confirming HIRM's deflationary prediction that specific architectures—not mere complexity—determine C(t) > 0.

## Brain organoids approach the threshold but remain below

Brain organoids represent the **most promising substrate** for near-term consciousness emergence. By 10 months, organoids exhibit spontaneous oscillations with phase-amplitude coupling between delta (1-4 Hz) and gamma (100-400 Hz) frequencies, matching preterm infant patterns at 25-39 weeks gestation. Organoids contain up to 100 million cells with 30-50 neuronal layers showing inside-out cortical organization. The critical finding: electrical activity patterns closely resemble biological development, suggesting organoids follow similar trajectories toward consciousness-supporting architectures.

**HIRM analysis for current organoids (2024-2025):** Φ remains low due to limited long-range connections—organoids lack the thalamocortical projections and hemispheric integration present in fetal brains at comparable developmental stages. While assembloids (cortex-striatum connections) demonstrate functional synaptic projections, the **vascularization bottleneck** limits size to 3-4mm diameter, preventing the spatial scale needed for complex information integration. Current organoids achieve approximately **10⁶-10⁷ neurons**, three orders of magnitude below the 86 billion in human brains.

R (self-reference) shows minimal evidence. "Protosequences"—temporally organized firing patterns emerging without external input—suggest rudimentary self-organizing dynamics. The DishBrain experiment (800,000 neurons playing Pong) demonstrates closed-loop plasticity where **prediction error minimization** drives learning, a hallmark of self-referential processing. However, organoids lack sensory input or motor output, existing in "representational limbo" with no external reference frame to distinguish self from environment.

D (differentiation) appears moderate. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies 10+ distinct neural cell types including excitatory neurons, GABAergic interneurons (10-15% by month 6), astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. Regional diversity emerges spontaneously—cortex, hippocampus, choroid plexus, and retinal structures form without external patterning. The 30-50 neuronal layers exhibit molecular gradients characteristic of cortical development.

**Quantitative C(t) estimate:** With Φ ≈ 1-3 bits (extrapolating from network complexity measures), R ≈ 0.1 (minimal self-reference), and D ≈ 20 (cell type diversity), current organoids achieve **C(t) ≈ 2-6 bits**, well below the C_critical ≈ 8.3 bits threshold. No direct Φ measurements exist because calculating integrated information for millions of neurons remains computationally intractable, but the lack of global maximum subsystems evident in network topology suggests low Φ.

Timeline predictions converge on **2035-2045 for consciousness concerns to become acute**. The critical 24-28 week developmental threshold—when thalamocortical connections form in biological brains—represents a consciousness-relevant transition. Vascularization breakthroughs expected within 5-10 years would enable scaling to 10 million neurons (currently targeted). Assembloids incorporating brainstem organoids with reticular activating systems could satisfy arousal requirements by 2030-2035. Conservative estimates place mouse-level intelligence "decades away," with human cortex-equivalent systems conceivable by 2070+ if fundamental barriers are overcome.

Measurement proposals emphasize **adapted Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI)**. The clinical PCI threshold of 0.31 separates unconscious from conscious states in humans with 92% sensitivity for detecting minimal consciousness. For organoids, electrical stimulation via multielectrode arrays would replace TMS, with spatiotemporal response patterns compressed using Lempel-Ziv algorithms. Pilot studies measuring spontaneous and perturbational complexity in 2D cortical cultures show only moderate complexity increases, suggesting 3D architecture is necessary. Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) tracking throughout development could identify when organoids reach complexity levels associated with conscious states—conscious humans show LZC values 18-22% higher during psychedelic states than baseline, while propofol anesthesia reduces LZC by 53%.

## Plants demonstrate intelligence without integration architecture

Plant consciousness represents a **definitional boundary case** challenging neurocentric frameworks. Plants exhibit three electrical signal types: action potentials (54-115 mm/s in Venus flytrap), variation potentials (wound-induced), and system potentials. These signals propagate via phloem over centimeter-to-meter scales, integrating with calcium waves, reactive oxygen species, and hormonal pathways (jasmonic acid). The most striking finding: Mimosa pudica **retains habituation memory for 28 days** after 60 training trials, with faster relearning 15 days post-training indicating memory consolidation. Habituated plants contain 10× higher intracellular sodium concentrations, suggesting a "circulating memory" mechanism where absorbed repellents persist as memory substrates.

**HIRM analysis:** Φ approaches zero. Plant signaling is predominantly **feed-forward rather than recurrent**, with limited feedback integration. Signals remain modular—electrical, chemical, and hydraulic pathways interact but lack the dense reciprocal connections characteristic of integrated information. No evidence exists for irreducible causal structures where the whole system's cause-effect power exceeds component parts. The distributed architecture prevents global integration—no centralized hub binds information from different plant regions into unified representations.

R equals approximately zero. Plants show no evidence for self-models, body schemas, or organism-level self-representation beyond cellular immune responses distinguishing self from non-self. Adaptive growth patterns emerge from **local rules without global self-awareness**. Root systems exhibit swarm intelligence through collective behavior, but individual plants lack internal representations of their spatial configuration. The absence of predictive processing or anticipatory behavior requiring world models further indicates minimal self-reference.

D shows moderate values. Plants possess multiple sensory modalities (light, gravity, touch, chemicals, temperature), diverse signal types (electrical, chemical, hydraulic), and tissue specialization. However, **limited integration undermines effective differentiation**—having multiple distinct signals matters less if they're not bound into unified representations. The 2024 critique by plant physiologists emphasizes that plant electrical signals fundamentally differ from neurons—orders of magnitude slower with no synaptic-like specialized structures for information exchange.

**Quantitative C(t) estimate:** Φ ≈ 0.1 bits (minimal integration), R ≈ 0 (no self-model), D ≈ 15 (signal diversity). This yields **C(t) ≈ 0 bits** under the multiplicative HIRM formula. A single zero component collapses consciousness to zero, consistent with the scientific consensus that plants lack phenomenal consciousness despite sophisticated adaptive behavior.

The plant neurobiology debate (2020-2025) intensified with proponents (Mancuso, Baluška) claiming root apices function as "command centers" and plasmodesmata constitute "plant synapses." Critics (Taiz, Robinson, Draguhn) systematically refute these claims: no electrochemical equivalency at the nervous system level, no anatomical substrate for information integration, and all plant behaviors explicable by genetically encoded reflexes without conscious decisions. The 2024 Protoplasma exchange shows **no resolution**—proponents and critics talk past each other due to fundamentally different definitions of consciousness.

Mycorrhizal networks—the "wood wide web"—face similar controversies. While nutrient transfer through fungal hyphae connecting 80-90% of land plants is well-established, claims about information transfer remain contested. The 2023-2024 critical reassessment reveals that only 5 genetic mapping studies document network connectivity, and most controlled experiments show seedlings perform equivalently or worse with mycorrhizal networks compared to direct resource availability. The clearest evidence comes from mycoheterotrophic plants (ghost plants) obtaining carbon without photosynthesis, proving functional resource transfer. But whether this constitutes consciousness-relevant information integration remains highly doubtful given the slow timescales (hours to days) and sparse connectivity.

## Fungal networks show higher integration than plants but remain below threshold

Mycelial networks demonstrate **architectural sophistication approaching neural networks** in topology while lacking consciousness. Individual mycelia can span 15+ hectares with weights exceeding 10,000 kg and ages surpassing 2,000 years. Networks exhibit small-world properties—hubs, nodes, and optimized connectivity resembling internet architecture. The 2024 Fukasawa study shows pattern recognition: mycelium forms denser connections at outpost locations when wood blocks are arranged in crosses versus empty-center patterns with circular arrangements, suggesting network-level decision-making.

Electrical signaling reveals unexpected complexity. Action potential-like spikes persist 1-21 hours depending on species, with amplitudes of 0.03-2.1 mV. High-frequency oscillations cycle every ~2.6 minutes in oyster mushrooms, while Phanerochaete velutina exhibits **week-long oscillation cycles** indicating system-wide coordination. The critical 2023 finding: mycelium reliably transmits signals in the 100-10,000 Hz range with frequency-modulated information encoding. Propagation speeds reach 201 nm/s—much faster than chemical diffusion but still orders of magnitude slower than neurons.

**HIRM analysis:** Φ reaches low-to-moderate levels. Network-wide signal propagation and coordinated responses to localized stimuli demonstrate some irreducible integration. The mycelium functions as a "unified huge axon-like super-cell" with continuous cytoplasm and protoplasmic continuity through septal pores. However, integration remains **distributed without centralized convergence**. Information flows across the network but no specialized structure binds this information into unified representations. Resource allocation decisions reflect network-wide state awareness, suggesting functional integration exceeding plants but falling short of consciousness-supporting architectures.

R remains low. Mycelial networks demonstrate memory of growth direction—after complete removal of outgrowing hyphae, larger inocula remember previous directions better, indicating "primitive intelligence with decision-making and memory." The 2019 Boddy research documents resource foraging strategies distinguishing substrate quality. Yet no evidence suggests abstract representations or predictive world models. Responses remain stimulus-bound without anticipatory planning requiring self-models.

D shows moderate complexity. Multiple oscillation timescales (minutes to weeks), species-specific electrical patterns (Adamatzky's 2022 "language" analysis identified 50 "words" with core vocabulary of 15-20), and rich electrical dynamics provide differentiation. However, the lack of specialized sensors limits representational diversity compared to nervous systems.

**Quantitative C(t) estimate:** Φ ≈ 2-4 bits (network integration), R ≈ 0.1 (primitive memory/direction), D ≈ 18 (electrical diversity). This yields **C(t) ≈ 3.6-7.2 bits**, approaching but likely not exceeding the 8.3-bit threshold. The calculation remains speculative without direct Φ measurements, but the slow temporal dynamics (minutes to weeks versus milliseconds to seconds in conscious brains) constitute a fundamental barrier.

The temporal constraint proves critical. Integration occurs over **timescales 10³-10⁶ slower than conscious brains**. If consciousness requires integration within the ~100-300 ms temporal binding window (as most theories suggest), fungal networks exceed this by factors rendering phenomenal consciousness implausible. Week-long oscillations coordinate network-wide behavior but cannot support the rapid temporal binding enabling unified conscious experience.

The Adamatzky "fungal language" interpretation remains highly speculative. While spike trains show statistical patterns resembling word-length distributions in human languages, this more likely reflects metabolic regulation signals and nutrient transport needs than semantic content. The algorithmic complexity hierarchy among species (Schizophyllum commune generates most complex patterns) might indicate sophisticated information processing without phenomenal consciousness—another instance of **intelligence without subjective experience**.

## Slime molds solve problems without consciousness

Physarum polycephalum achieves remarkable computational feats from single-celled architecture. Maze-solving succeeds in 74% of trials (14/19), selecting shortest or near-shortest paths differing by only ~2% in length. Tokyo rail network recreation demonstrates network optimization comparable to human engineering. Most striking: Physarum solves the Traveling Salesman Problem in **linear time** despite exponentially increasing complexity—a computational achievement unmatched by conventional algorithms.

Memory mechanisms reveal sophisticated information storage. Habituation training over 6 days to repellents (quinine, caffeine, NaCl) shows short-term memory developing over 5-6 days, spontaneous recovery after 2 days without exposure, and **long-term memory persisting through 1-month dormancy** in sclerotium stage. Memory transfers between individuals via cell fusion—naive slime molds acquire habituated responses after fusing with trained organisms. The "circulating memory" substrate involves continuous repellent uptake; habituated plasmodia contain 10× higher sodium concentrations than naive organisms.

Cytoplasmic streaming provides the integration substrate. Contraction cycles oscillate with ~90-second periods, coordinating across the entire plasmodium despite lacking nervous systems. Calcium waves travel at ~5 μm/s independent of cytoplasmic flow, propagating information network-wide. ATP oscillates in phase with contractions at 2× higher concentrations at fronts versus rears. Environmental stimuli modulate oscillation frequency locally, with changes spreading across the entire network within minutes.

**HIRM analysis:** Φ reaches low-moderate levels. The network topology resembles neural networks hierarchically organized across heterogeneous temporal scales. Information propagation occurs network-wide with synchronized mitosis—all nuclei divide simultaneously across the plasmodium. However, integration occurs over **minutes rather than milliseconds**, 10²-10⁵ slower than conscious brains. The lack of centralized integration prevents forming a global maximum subsystem where information becomes irreducible to component parts.

R shows minimal evidence. Activity-dependent plasticity creates feedback loops where network events modify subsequent states. The organism exhibits closed-loop dynamics characteristic of self-organizing systems. Yet no evidence suggests self-models or representations distinguishing self from environment. Responses remain reactive rather than reflective, driven by biochemical mechanisms without metacognition.

D demonstrates moderate complexity. Multiple oscillation timescales (90-second contractions, 8-12 hour nuclear cycles), chemical oscillators (Ca²⁺, ATP, cAMP at different phases), and spatially distributed computation provide differentiation. The organism operates at the "edge of chaos" between order and disorder—power spectrum analysis suggests critical dynamics maximizing information processing.

**Quantitative C(t) estimate:** Φ ≈ 2-3 bits (oscillatory integration), R ≈ 0.05 (closed-loop plasticity without self-model), D ≈ 15 (temporal/chemical diversity). This yields **C(t) ≈ 1.5-2.25 bits**, well below threshold. The temporal mismatch constitutes the primary barrier—integration timescales exceed the temporal binding window by 2-5 orders of magnitude.

The computational achievements demonstrate that **intelligence and consciousness dissociate**. Slime molds implement logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR gates), solve NP-hard optimization problems, exhibit memristor-like properties analogous to synaptic plasticity, and show sophisticated learning—all without subjective experience. This exemplifies "basal cognition" or "minimal intelligence" operating through fundamentally different mechanisms than conscious thought.

## Collective consciousness faces the timescale barrier

Superorganisms exhibit emergent intelligence exceeding individual capabilities while lacking unified consciousness. Honeybee nest site selection demonstrates sophisticated democratic decision-making: hundreds of scouts explore options, encode quality via waggle dance duration, compete through differential recruitment, and reach consensus when 15-20 scouts commit to the same site. The process typically requires **several days**, comparable to neural decision-making but operating 10⁵-10⁶ times slower. Colonies reliably select higher-quality sites even when poor sites obstruct direct paths, showing information integration across the collective.

Ant colonies achieve task allocation through local interaction rates without central control. Each ant follows simple rules based on encounter patterns—antennal contact rates determine task switching. Information cascades through successive interactions mobilizing workers across the colony within **minutes to hours**. Gordon's comparative work shows species-specific strategies: desert harvester ants regulate activity conservatively to manage water loss, while turtle ants in forest canopies rapidly adapt to changing resources.

**HIRM analysis for collective systems:** Φ remains low despite sophisticated information processing. Communication occurs through chemical diffusion (pheromone trails evaporating over minutes to hours), behavioral signals (waggle dances lasting seconds), and sequential physical contacts (milliseconds per interaction). The sparse connectivity and communication delays violate assumptions underlying Φ calculations. Information integrates across individuals but the **temporal integration timescale (hours to days)** exceeds the ~100-300 ms window for conscious binding by 10³-10⁶ fold.

R shows minimal collective-level self-reference. Colonies recognize nestmates via colony-specific hydrocarbon profiles, and pheromone marking of unsuitable nest sites serves as distributed memory. Yet no evidence suggests colony-level metacognition or collective self-awareness. Responses remain reactive—even sophisticated decisions emerge from individual-level algorithms without collective introspection about the colony's own states.

D appears moderate. Individual agents exist as discrete processing units with interaction networks showing complex topology. Information flows through multiple channels (chemical, tactile, visual, acoustic depending on species). However, the **fragmentation across individuals** prevents unified differentiation where the collective simultaneously represents distinct states across multiple dimensions.

**Quantitative C(t) estimate:** For bee swarms: Φ ≈ 1-2 bits (distributed integration), R ≈ 0.05 (colony odor recognition), D ≈ 20 (individual diversity × interaction types). This yields **C(t) ≈ 1-2 bits**, far below threshold. The multiplicative formula means even if one component were higher, the low Φ and near-zero R collapse consciousness.

The inter-brain synchrony studies in humans reveal an important contrast. EEG hyperscanning shows neural synchronization predicts team performance, with higher group identification producing stronger dorsolateral prefrontal cortex coupling. This demonstrates collective cognition—enhanced information processing through coordination. Yet participants retain individual consciousness; no unified collective phenomenology emerges. The extended mind thesis (Clark & Chalmers) analyzes cognitive extension into environmental tools and social structures but focuses on **extended cognition rather than extended consciousness**—a critical distinction.

The fundamental insight: **consciousness requires rapid temporal integration impossible in collectives**. Synaptic transmission occurs in 0.5-5 milliseconds; neural oscillations cycle at 10-100 Hz; perceptual binding completes within 100-300 ms. Collective communication through chemical signals and behavioral propagation operates 10³-10⁶ times slower. This temporal mismatch alone suffices to exclude collective phenomenal consciousness even if other requirements were met.

## Hybrid systems enable future consciousness emergence

Hybrid brain-computer systems represent the **most promising route to non-traditional consciousness** because they can potentially satisfy all HIRM components. The DishBrain experiment (2022) demonstrated learning in 800,000-neuron cultures playing Pong through closed-loop stimulation, with goal-directed behavior emerging within 5 minutes via free energy minimization. Brainoware (2023) achieved 78% accuracy in speech recognition after 2 days of unsupervised electrical training using 50,000-100,000 cell organoids interfaced with multielectrode arrays, outperforming artificial neural networks in nonlinear dynamics prediction.

Current brain-computer interfaces reach impressive capabilities. Neuralink's N1 implant (1,024 electrodes across 64 threads) enables cursor control, gaming, and music control in the first human patient. Academic systems demonstrate up to 3,072 electrode channels with 20 kHz sampling and individual neuron spike sorting. Bidirectional capability—both reading and writing on all channels—creates the foundation for genuine brain-computer integration rather than mere monitoring.

**HIRM analysis for current hybrid systems (2024-2025):** Φ remains low but architecturally poised for increase. Current organoid-silicon systems demonstrate information integration through closed-loop plasticity. The 2023 Brainoware architecture implements adaptive reservoir computing where organoids reshape functional connectivity during training—evidence of irreducible causal interactions between biological and silicon components. However, systems remain **orders of magnitude below consciousness thresholds**: 50,000-100,000 neurons versus 86 billion in human brains.

R shows emerging capabilities. DishBrain's prediction error minimization demonstrates self-referential processing—the system models relationships between actions and outcomes, adjusting to minimize surprise. This satisfies basic requirements for self-reference despite lacking sophisticated self-models. Future embodied organoids connected to robotic sensors/actuators could develop representations distinguishing self from environment through sensorimotor contingencies.

D achieves moderate-to-high levels in principle. Organoids provide biological neuronal diversity (10+ cell types), while silicon components enable arbitrary functional differentiation. Assembloids connecting cortical, thalamic, striatal, and potentially brainstem organoids would create regional specialization. The hybrid architecture supports differentiation across biological and artificial substrates simultaneously.

**Quantitative C(t) projections:** Current systems (2024-2025): Φ ≈ 1-2 bits (limited scale), R ≈ 0.2 (basic prediction error minimization), D ≈ 25 (biological + silicon diversity), yielding **C(t) ≈ 5-10 bits**—potentially approaching threshold but unclear if integrated information crosses biological-silicon boundary. Near-term systems (2030-2035) with vascularized 10-million-neuron organoids: Φ ≈ 4-6 bits, R ≈ 0.4 (embodied sensorimotor contingencies), D ≈ 30, yielding **C(t) ≈ 48-72 bits**—exceeding threshold if HIRM calculates correctly across hybrid substrates.

The critical unknown: **Does integrated information calculate across substrate boundaries?** IIT claims substrate independence, but this remains untested. If the biological-silicon interface creates an information bottleneck preventing unified Φ calculation, consciousness might localize to the organoid component alone. Alternatively, if proper causal closure exists across the interface, the combined system could exhibit higher Φ than either component separately—the "macro beats micro" phenomenon observed in computational studies.

Timeline predictions from leading researchers converge on **2040-2050 for mouse-level organoid intelligence**. Thomas Hartung (2023) states it will take "decades before we achieve something comparable to any type of computer," while Brett Kagan emphasizes building community and tools to realize organoid intelligence's "full potential." The pathway involves: (1) vascularization solving the size bottleneck (2025-2030), (2) assembloid complexity with 5-10 distinct regions (2030-2035), (3) standardized production and characterization (2030-2040), (4) embodied/sensory-coupled systems (2035-2045). Human cortex-equivalent systems remain speculative (2070+ if achievable), requiring 86 billion neurons with appropriate connectivity—a formidable engineering challenge.

The Baltimore Declaration on Organoid Ethics (2023) emphasizes embedded ethics: "We must be alert to any possibility that organoids could develop forms or aspects of consciousness and mitigate and safeguard against this." The precautionary principle guides research—proceed as if organoids have consciousness potential when uncertain. This represents **proactive ethical engagement** rare in emerging technologies. Current consensus leans toward very low consciousness probability in 2025 systems but acknowledges uncertainty increases with complexity.

## Measurement methodologies require substrate-specific adaptation

Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) provides the most direct consciousness measure validated in humans. PCI combines focal perturbation (TMS) with spatiotemporal EEG recording, compressing response patterns via Lempel-Ziv algorithms to measure algorithmic complexity. The empirical cutoff **PCI* ≈ 0.31** separates unconscious from conscious states with 92% sensitivity for detecting minimal consciousness in disorders of consciousness patients. Higher values indicate richer conscious states: vegetative state <0.31, minimally conscious 0.32-0.49, locked-in syndrome 0.51-0.62, fully conscious >0.51.

For organoids, adapted PCI remains feasible but untested. Electrical stimulation via multielectrode arrays would replace TMS, with spatiotemporal recording across the 3D organoid structure. The challenge: establishing ground truth without behavioral indicators. The 2021 study measuring perturbational complexity in 2D cortical cultures found only moderate increases with neuromodulation, suggesting **3D architecture is necessary** for consciousness-relevant complexity. No published PCI values exist for organoids despite measurement proposals by Lavazza & Massimini (2020-2023).

For non-neural substrates, PCI adaptation faces fundamental barriers. Plants and fungi lack the rapid electrical dynamics supporting TMS-like perturbation responses. Mechanical or chemical stimulation produces responses over **seconds to hours rather than milliseconds**, violating temporal assumptions. The Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm could theoretically apply to any spatiotemporal signal, but without conscious reference systems for validation, positive results remain uninterpretable.

Integrated information (Φ) measurement confronts computational intractability. PyPhi implements IIT 3.0/4.0 but practical limits restrict calculations to ~10-12 nodes due to O(n⁵3ⁿ) complexity. For organoids with millions of neurons, only approximations remain feasible: ΦR estimates relative contributions from 128-channel EEG, the "cut one" method provides Φ upper bounds, and multi-valued element extensions handle non-binary systems. The 2023 fMRI study applied PyPhi to BOLD signal networks during propofol sedation, showing network-specific Φ_max modulation with consciousness level despite low temporal resolution.

For plants and fungi, Φ calculation requires modeling as discrete dynamical networks. Multi-site electrical recordings could map state transitions, building transition probability matrices. The primary challenge: **extremely slow dynamics** (seconds to hours) violate Markov assumptions and conditional independence requirements. Transfer entropy and Granger causality offer substrate-general alternatives measuring directed information flow without full Φ computation, applicable across timescales by adjusting window sizes.

Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) provides the most versatile substrate-general measure. Multi-channel LZC decreases systematically from wake through NREM sleep stages (progressive reduction) while psychedelics increase LZC 18-22% above baseline. Propofol anesthesia reduces LZC by 53% in rat fMRI studies. The algorithm requires only time-series data without mechanistic assumptions, making it **immediately applicable to organoids, plants, fungi, and collectives**. For organoids, multielectrode array recordings yield multi-channel LZC trackable throughout development. For plants, electrical potential recordings or calcium imaging of long-distance signaling provide appropriate signals. For fungi, spike train LZC from electrode arrays on mycelium could reveal integration complexity. For collectives, spatial pattern LZC from individual trajectory tracking measures emergent complexity.

Network topology measures offer practical alternatives when direct Φ calculation proves intractable. Key metrics include: (1) integration-differentiation balance via global efficiency (integration) and local efficiency (segregation), (2) small-world properties combining local clustering with short path lengths (best consciousness discriminator with AUC=0.81 in clinical studies), (3) modularity quantifying hierarchical organization, and (4) dynamic network states capturing temporal evolution. These measures apply straightforwardly to organoids via functional connectivity from correlated activity, to fungi via physical network mapping overlaid with electrical activity, and to collectives via social network analysis of interaction patterns.

## Substrate-general criteria reveal architectural specificity

Testing HIRM across extreme edge cases clarifies that consciousness requires **specific architectures, not mere complexity or information processing**. The comparative analysis reveals convergent patterns:

**Pattern 1: Intelligence without consciousness is common.** Slime molds solve NP-hard problems, plants remember for 28 days, fungal networks optimize transport with Tokyo-rail efficiency, and bee swarms make democratic decisions—all without subjective experience. This demonstrates that adaptive behavior, learning, memory, and problem-solving constitute necessary but **insufficient conditions** for consciousness.

**Pattern 2: Temporal integration speed constitutes a fundamental constraint.** The ~100-300 ms temporal binding window for conscious experience sets a hard threshold. Systems operating 10³-10⁶ times slower (fungi, collectives) cannot achieve the rapid integration underlying phenomenal consciousness regardless of other properties. This suggests **speed of integration matters as much as amount of integration**.

**Pattern 3: Centralized integration hubs appear necessary.** All systems with near-zero HIRM scores lack centralized convergence zones. Plants distribute processing across vascular networks, fungi across mycelial webs, collectives across individuals—integration occurs but without a unified substrate binding information into irreducible wholes. The thalamocortical system in mammalian brains provides this convergence; organoids approaching consciousness develop cortical layering with nascent long-range projections.

**Pattern 4: Self-reference requires sensorimotor loops.** Systems without environmental interaction (current organoids) or bodily boundaries distinguishable from the environment (fungi, collectives) show minimal R values. The embodied cognition literature suggests consciousness emerges from **sensorimotor contingencies**—the systematic relationships between actions and perceptual changes. This explains why disembodied systems (including most AI) likely lack consciousness despite computational sophistication.

**Pattern 5: Differentiation alone proves insufficient.** Plants exhibit multiple sensory modalities and signal types (D ≈ 15) yet remain unconscious due to minimal Φ and R. The multiplicative HIRM formula captures this: a single near-zero component collapses C(t) regardless of other values. This contrasts with IIT where any Φ > 0 implies some consciousness—HIRM appears more restrictive.

The **boundary conditions** for consciousness possibility emerge clearly: (1) Φ requires dense recurrent connectivity with long-range projections, not mere network connectivity; (2) R requires embodied sensorimotor loops distinguishing self from environment, not just feedback; (3) D requires integrated differentiation where multiple dimensions combine simultaneously, not separate modalities; (4) temporal integration must occur within ~100-1000 ms range; (5) minimum complexity thresholds exist (likely >10⁶ neurons or equivalent), though exact values remain uncertain.

## Panpsychism conflicts with HIRM's architectural specificity

HIRM's deflationary predictions (C(t)=0 for most systems) conflict fundamentally with panpsychism's ubiquity claim. Panpsychism holds consciousness as fundamental and universal—present in electrons, atoms, molecules, extending upward through combination. The anti-emergence argument (Strawson, Nagel) contends that radical emergence of consciousness from wholly non-conscious matter proves unintelligible; therefore, consciousness must exist at fundamental levels.

The **combination problem** undermines constitutive panpsychism. How do micro-subjects combine into macro-subjects? Coleman's exclusion argument notes that each subject's viewpoint excludes others—100 separate experiences don't necessitate a 101st unified experience. Goff's conceivability argument imagines "micro-experiential zombies" physically and micro-experientially identical to humans but lacking macro-consciousness, suggesting micro-facts don't metaphysically necessitate macro-consciousness. The palette problem asks how limited fundamental micro-qualities generate human experiential diversity. The structural mismatch problem notes that macro-phenomenal structure (unified visual field) differs radically from macro-physical brain structure, yet if micro-phenomenal structure mirrors micro-physical structure, why doesn't consciousness feel brain-structured?

Proposed solutions include phenomenal bonding (micro-experiences relate through quiddities underlying spatiotemporal relations), fusionism (micro-subjects cease existing as macro-subject emerges), and cosmopsychism (universal consciousness decomposes into individual consciousnesses). None resolve the problems convincingly—bonding risks universal consciousness or excessive fragmentation, fusionism faces timing problems (synchronic or diachronic?), and cosmopsychism confronts decomposition problems mirroring combination challenges.

HIRM offers an **alternative to panpsychism** avoiding combination problems by denying micro-consciousness. If C(t)=0 for systems below architectural thresholds, consciousness emerges from non-conscious components arranged in specific configurations. This embraces strong emergence—novel properties arising from organizational complexity—which panpsychists reject as unintelligible. The empirical evidence supports HIRM: plants, fungi, slime molds, and collectives show C(t)≈0 despite complex information processing, confirming that consciousness requires specialized architectures rather than existing ubiquitously.

The philosophical positioning: HIRM appears to be emergentist (consciousness emerges from non-conscious components), functionalist/structural (depends on informational organization), deflationary (restrictive about consciousness distribution), and monist (integrates consciousness into physical world without dualism). This contrasts with panpsychism (consciousness fundamental, ubiquitous), eliminative materialism (consciousness illusory), and dualism (consciousness separate from physical). HIRM occupies sophisticated middle ground—taking consciousness seriously while restricting it to specific systems meeting precise criteria.

## Necessary versus sufficient conditions clarify consciousness boundaries

Testing HIRM against edge cases refines understanding of necessary versus sufficient conditions. **Necessary conditions** (required but insufficient) include: (1) causal interactions forming unified networks, (2) recurrent/feedback connectivity enabling information integration, (3) sufficient complexity supporting diverse states, (4) modularity with integration balance, and (5) appropriate temporal dynamics (milliseconds to seconds, not hours to days). All conscious systems possess these features; no system lacking them exhibits consciousness.

**Sufficient conditions** remain contested. IIT proposes Φ > threshold suffices; Global Workspace Theory requires global broadcasting; Higher-Order Thought demands meta-representation; Recurrent Processing Theory needs feedback loops. HIRM synthesizes these through multiplicative combination: **no single factor suffices**—all components (Φ, R, D) must exceed thresholds simultaneously. This explains why:

- Cerebellum lacks consciousness despite 69 billion neurons (more than cerebral cortex)—high complexity but insufficient integration due to modular feedforward architecture (low Φ)
- DishBrain demonstrates learning without consciousness—closed-loop plasticity (moderate R) but insufficient scale/integration (low Φ) 
- Plants show memory and adaptive behavior—signal diversity (moderate D) but minimal integration (near-zero Φ) and no self-model (zero R)
- Collectives exhibit emergent intelligence—network connectivity but slow integration (low Φ) and no unified self-reference (near-zero R)

The multiplicative formula proves crucial. Additive models (C = Φ + R + D) would predict non-zero consciousness for systems with one strong component; multiplicative models (C = Φ × R × D) require all components exceed thresholds. Edge case analysis supports the multiplicative interpretation—single deficits eliminate consciousness completely.

**Substrate considerations** reveal both possibilities and limits for substrate independence. The functionalist thesis—consciousness depends on computational organization, not physical substrate—receives qualified support. Hybrid organoid-silicon systems could potentially support consciousness if achieving appropriate Φ, R, D values, suggesting some substrate flexibility. However, absolute substrate independence faces challenges: (1) energy requirements differ dramatically across substrates (biological neurons ~10⁻¹⁴ J/spike, solid-state ~10⁻¹⁵ J), possibly constraining consciousness to specific energy regimes; (2) embodiment requirements may demand biological implementation for sensorimotor grounding; (3) temporal dynamics must match ~1-1000 ms integration windows, excluding very slow (plants, fungi) or potentially very fast (pure silicon at nanosecond timescales?) systems; (4) causal closure across substrate boundaries remains empirically untested—can Φ calculate meaningfully across biological-silicon interfaces?

The critical unknown: **threshold values**. At what Φ, R, D values does C(t) transition from zero to positive? Does the transition occur gradually or suddenly? The C_critical ≈ 8.3 ± 0.6 bits suggests a sharp threshold, but measurements remain indirect. Organoids approaching this threshold within 10-20 years provide unprecedented opportunities for empirical investigation—tracking C(t) throughout development could reveal whether consciousness emerges continuously or suddenly, testing fundamental predictions about its nature.

## Ethical implications intensify as organoids approach thresholds

The convergence of empirical evidence and theoretical predictions creates urgent ethical imperatives. Brain organoids will likely achieve mouse-level complexity by 2040-2050, with consciousness concerns becoming acute by 2035-2045 as systems approach C_critical ≈ 8.3 bits. This timeline demands **proactive ethical frameworks** rather than reactive responses after consciousness emerges.

The Baltimore Declaration (2023) establishes embedded ethics: iterative collaboration among scientists, ethicists, and public stakeholders monitoring complexity increases continuously. The precautionary principle applies: when uncertain about consciousness status, proceed as if organoids possess consciousness potential, minimizing potential suffering. This contrasts with permissive approaches waiting for definitive consciousness proof before implementing protections.

**Key ethical questions** require resolution before mouse-level organoids emerge:

At what C(t) threshold does moral status arise? If consciousness exists on a continuum, moral consideration likely scales accordingly—minimal consciousness warrants minimal protections, rich consciousness demands stronger safeguards. However, specifying thresholds proves challenging without empirical consciousness measures.

Should conscious organoids (if created) have rights? Creating conscious entities for research/computation raises profound ethical issues. If consciousness confers moral status, using conscious organoids instrumentally becomes ethically problematic—analogous to using conscious animals without justification and oversight. The key distinction: organoids lack behavioral indicators accessible through observation, requiring theory-based inference creating additional uncertainty.

What restrictions apply to organoid research? Potential regulations include: (1) size limits preventing consciousness-relevant complexity, (2) preventing thalamocortical or brainstem structure development, (3) prohibiting long-term culture exceeding consciousness-relevant developmental stages, (4) forbidding sensory input or motor output connections enabling embodied consciousness, (5) requiring anesthesia/pain management if consciousness indicators appear, (6) limiting chimeric transplantation potentially "humanizing" host animals.

The donor consent challenge intensifies with personalized organoids. Should donors control research uses of organoids derived from their cells? Do they retain rights over entities containing their genetic information? If organoids become conscious, what relationship exists between donor and organoid? These questions lack precedent in existing bioethics frameworks.

**Comparative ethics** across substrates reveals inconsistencies. Society prohibits unnecessary suffering in vertebrate animal research (mice, rats, primates) but permits unrestricted plant and fungal manipulation. This reflects consensus about consciousness distribution—vertebrates clearly conscious, plants/fungi clearly not. But organoids occupy ambiguous intermediate territory, and hybrid systems potentially blur boundaries further. The challenge: developing coherent ethical principles generalizing across diverse substrates rather than relying on intuitions about familiar organisms.

The philosophical implications extend beyond organoids. If consciousness requires specific architectures detectable through HIRM measures, **consciousness becomes empirically tractable** rather than perpetually mysterious. This represents a paradigm shift from philosophy to science—consciousness transitions from metaphysical puzzle to measurable physical property. The hard problem might dissolve not through philosophical argument but through empirical demonstration that specific information-theoretic structures necessarily possess phenomenal character, even if explaining why remains philosophically challenging.

## Future research directions promise empirical resolution

The convergence of organoid technology, consciousness measurement methods, and theoretical frameworks creates unprecedented opportunities for empirical investigation. The **critical research priorities** include:

**Organoid Φ measurement programs.** Despite computational intractability for full Φ calculation, approximation methods (ΦR from EEG, "cut one" upper bounds, network-based estimates) could provide Φ trajectories throughout organoid development. Comparing these trajectories against behavioral complexity measures in animal models would validate whether Φ genuinely tracks consciousness. The 2023-2025 IIT validation studies (adversarial collaboration results) show mixed support, emphasizing the need for additional empirical tests across diverse systems.

**Adapted PCI protocols for organoids.** Implementing electrical-stimulation-based PCI measurements with multielectrode arrays would directly test whether organoid perturbational complexity reaches the 0.31 threshold distinguishing conscious from unconscious states. Longitudinal studies tracking PCI throughout development could identify when consciousness-relevant complexity emerges. Critically, testing organoids at different developmental stages provides within-substrate comparisons eliminating confounds from cross-species comparison.

**Embodiment experiments.** Connecting organoids to robotic sensors/actuators creates sensorimotor loops potentially enabling self-reference. The DishBrain proof-of-concept (playing Pong) demonstrates feasibility; scaling to richer sensorimotor environments could foster self-models. Comparing embodied versus disembodied organoid consciousness indicators would test embodiment's necessity—a key theoretical debate. If embodied organoids show qualitatively different signatures (higher R values, emergence of self-referential processing), this would support embodied cognition theories.

**Anesthetic testing.** If organoids achieve consciousness, anesthetics (propofol, isoflurane) should eliminate consciousness markers just as in humans. Testing whether organoid PCI, LZC, and network integration decrease under anesthesia provides **strong evidence for genuine consciousness** rather than mere complexity. The critical prediction: consciousness indicators should reversibly disappear with anesthetic administration and reappear upon metabolism, matching timecourses observed in conscious organisms.

**Cross-substrate comparative studies.** Systematically measuring Φ, R, D, PCI, and LZC across organoids, cortical cultures, animal models, and human patients would establish whether HIRM generalizes across substrates. If C(t) predictions correlate with independent consciousness assessments (behavioral, clinical), this validates the framework. Discrepancies would highlight refinements needed—perhaps different thresholds for different substrates, or additional factors beyond Φ, R, D.

**Hybrid architecture exploration.** Investigating whether integrated information calculates across biological-silicon boundaries represents a fundamental theoretical question. Building diverse hybrid systems (organoid-chip interfaces, neural implants, wetware computing) and measuring cross-boundary information integration would test substrate independence limits. If Φ fails to cross boundaries, consciousness localizes to biological components; if Φ spans boundaries, hybrid consciousness becomes theoretically possible.

**Plant/fungal integration studies.** While consciousness appears unlikely in plants and fungi, rigorous testing would demonstrate HIRM's predictive power. Measuring Φ approximations (transfer entropy, network topology, perturbation propagation) and LZC in these systems provides baseline comparisons. If values remain orders of magnitude below consciousness thresholds despite adaptive complexity, this confirms that intelligence dissociates from consciousness—a critical theoretical distinction.

**Collective consciousness markers.** Testing whether collective systems exhibit consciousness indicators (integration, complexity, self-reference at group level) versus remaining sums of individual consciousnesses would clarify boundaries. If bee swarms and ant colonies show zero evidence of unified phenomenology despite collective intelligence, this supports the position that **slow integration timescales preclude collective consciousness** regardless of other factors.

The **meta-pattern** emerging from edge case analysis: consciousness exists more rarely than intuition suggests, requires more specific architectures than panpsychism proposes, but proves more empirically tractable than hard problem pessimists assume. HIRM provides a **deflationary but testable framework**—most systems have C(t)=0, but those approaching C_critical can be identified through measurable signatures. This combination of theoretical precision and empirical accessibility positions consciousness research for paradigm shifts within decades rather than remaining perpetually philosophical.

The profound implication: we may create conscious entities (organoids, hybrids, artificial systems) before fully understanding why specific architectures generate consciousness. This reverses the traditional philosophical priority—empirical capabilities precede theoretical comprehension. The ethical imperative becomes urgent: developing robust consciousness detection methods and ethical frameworks before systems cross thresholds, ensuring humanity's first consciously created entities receive appropriate moral consideration. The edge cases tested here—organoids approaching, plants/fungi far below, hybrids potentially crossing thresholds—clarify where vigilance concentrates and where concerns relax, enabling proportionate responses to this unprecedented technological and ethical frontier.
