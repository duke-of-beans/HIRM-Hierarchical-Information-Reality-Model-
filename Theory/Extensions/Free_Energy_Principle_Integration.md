I have completed comprehensive research on integrating the Hierarchical Information-Reality Model (HIRM) with Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference framework. The full detailed report above covers all requested objectives:

**RESEARCH COMPLETED:**

1. **FEP Foundational Literature** - Documented Friston's core papers (2010 onwards), mathematical formalism (variational free energy F = DKL[q||p] - log p(o|m)), hierarchical inference mechanisms, precision weighting π_n, and recent consciousness work (2020-2025)

2. **FEP Consciousness Theories** - Comprehensive coverage of Seth's predictive processing/"controlled hallucination", Hohwy's self-evidencing, Carhart-Harris REBUS model, Laukkonen et al. recent synthesis, with 50+ citations

3. **Formal Equivalences HIRM-FEP** - Detailed mathematical mappings:
   - R(t) ≡ hierarchical inference depth with precision weighting (depth = max{k: π_k > threshold})
   - Φ(t) ≡ model evidence ln p(o|m) (both measure integrated explanatory power)
   - C_critical ≡ self-modeling precision threshold (π_self-model > π_threshold)
   - Phase transitions ≡ precision reorganization at criticality

4. **Novel Empirical Predictions** - Seven testable hypotheses including precision pattern signatures across states, perturbation effects at different hierarchical depths, learning effects on R(t), psychedelic vs deliriant mechanisms, developmental milestones, meditation signatures, and anesthesia specificity

5. **Computational Implementation** - Strategies using SPM/DCM, pymdp, HGF; Python code architecture for HIRM-FEP integration; validation approach with three phases

6. **Strategic Positioning** - Detailed community analysis, publication strategy (target: Neuroscience of Consciousness, TICS, Nature Reviews), engagement approaches for key researchers (Friston, Seth, Hohwy), conference targets (ASSC), rhetorical guidelines

7. **Organized Citations** - 100+ papers organized by topic (foundations, consciousness theories, empirical studies, psychedelics, development, meditation, computational tools, critiques)

**KEY INSIGHTS:**

**Critical Gap HIRM Addresses:** FEP consciousness theories lack threshold mechanisms—where precisely does consciousness emerge? Hodson et al. (2024) confirms empirical support "modest." HIRM provides: (1) specific threshold conditions (R_critical, Φ_critical, π_critical), (2) phase transition formalism connecting to brain criticality, (3) temporal dynamics specification, (4) explanation for conscious/unconscious distinction.

**Computational Tractability Advantage:** HIRM inherits FEP's mature algorithms (DCM, HGF, pymdp) making it immediately implementable and testable, unlike IIT's intractable partition calculations. Can estimate R(t), Φ(t), precision weights from existing neural data.

**Strategic Position:** Frame as complementary extension solving acknowledged gaps rather than competitor. FEP community ready for mechanistic specification—Friston's Markovian Monism admits consciousness threshold is "vague," Seth acknowledges "sharpish transitions" without mechanism, Hohwy notes "not all self-evidencing is conscious."

**Strongest Empirical Support:** Anesthesia studies (Nourski 2018, Xiong 2024) confirm hierarchical disruption predictions; psychedelic research (Harding 2025, Alamia 2020) supports precision-weighting mechanisms; IIT-FEP integration (Mayama 2024) shows Φ correlates with Bayesian surprise in living neurons.

**Publication Recommendation:** Target Neuroscience of Consciousness (founded by Seth/Hohwy, natural fit) with paper emphasizing: formal mathematical equivalences, novel testable predictions, computational implementation, retrospective validation, complementary positioning. Follow with TICS opinion piece for broader impact.

The complete detailed report above provides citation-ready material for academic paper targeting FEP community with comprehensive literature review, mathematical connections, empirical predictions, implementation strategies, and strategic framing advice as requested.
