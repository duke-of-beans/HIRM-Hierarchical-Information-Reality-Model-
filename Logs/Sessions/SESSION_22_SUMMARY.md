# SESSION 22 SUMMARY
## Literature Synthesis: Empirical Support for HIRM

**Date:** 2025-12-20
**Focus:** Web-based research synthesis (no computational experiments due to crash prevention)

---

## ACCOMPLISHMENTS

### 1. Comprehensive Literature Search
Conducted 8 systematic web searches covering:
- Criticality across sleep stages
- Integrated information (Phi) during sleep/anesthesia
- Self-reference and metacognition neural correlates
- Dimensionality and complexity measures
- Anesthesia hysteresis
- Miller's 7+/-2 cognitive limits

### 2. Key Findings Supporting HIRM

| HIRM Component | Empirical Support | Key Source |
|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Criticality decreases in N3 | DFA ~1.5 in N3 vs ~1.0 wake | Oxford SLEEP Oct 2025 |
| Phi decreases unconscious | Global + local Phi reduction | Oxford NC Feb 2025 |
| R decreases unconscious | Metacognition reduced NREM/REM | J Cog Neuro 2017 |
| D decreases unconscious | Entropy/LZc lower in anesthesia | Multiple 2015-2023 |
| Hysteresis exists | EC50 induction != emergence | PMC 2025, PNAS 2017 |

### 3. Synthesis Document Created
- File: D:\HIRM\Empirical\Results\LITERATURE_SYNTHESIS_SESSION_22.md
- 230 lines comprehensive synthesis
- 10 key papers cited
- Gaps identified for future work

## KEY DISCOVERIES

### Most Significant Finding
**PubMed Oct 2023:** Criticality measures predict PCI (Perturbational Complexity Index) with <7% error, establishing direct link between criticality and consciousness complexity measures.

### HIRM-Aligned Framework Discovered
**ArXiv Dec 2025:** New composite measure Psi integrates:
1. Hierarchical integration (cf. Phi)
2. Organized complexity (cf. D)
3. Metastability (cf. phase transition dynamics)

This independently converges on HIRM's multiplicative structure!

### Hysteresis Confirmation
Multiple papers confirm anesthesia induction/emergence asymmetry cannot be explained by pharmacokinetics alone - supports HIRM's bistability prediction near C_critical.

---

## GAPS IDENTIFIED

1. **No direct C(t) computation** - No study uses HIRM's exact operationalization
2. **8.3-bit threshold untested** - Quantitative threshold prediction unvalidated
3. **Component independence unknown** - Phi-R-D correlations unmeasured
4. **Hysteresis ratio unquantified** - HIRM predicts 1.3-1.5x, needs comparison

## NEXT SESSION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Option A: Quantify Published Data
Extract numerical values from papers (EC50 ratios, DFA exponents, Phi values) to compare against HIRM predictions

### Option B: Prepare Computational Scripts
Create run-ready scripts for David to execute locally on Sleep-EDF data

### Option C: Expand Literature Search
- Cross-species criticality comparison
- Developmental C trajectory (infant consciousness)
- Psychedelic paradox (DMT subcritical but enhanced consciousness)
