## KEY CONTENT ADDED

### Section 5 Highlights
1. **Dynamic range maximization** at criticality (Kinouchi & Copelli 2006)
2. **Metastability** as enabling mechanism for consciousness
3. **Zero-multiplier theorem validation:**
   - Meditation cessation: High Phi + Zero R = Zero consciousness
   - Autism: Component-specific disruption patterns
4. **Falsifiable predictions** distinguishing HIRM from alternatives
