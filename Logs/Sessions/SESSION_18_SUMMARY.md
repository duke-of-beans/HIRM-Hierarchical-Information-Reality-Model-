## SESSION LOG

### 18:1 - Session Initialization
- Read BUILD_STATUS.md - Session 17 COMPLETE
- System audit-compliant after Session 17

### 18:2-18:5 - Package Rename (Pre-crash)
- Updated setup.py, __init__.py, test imports
- Renamed ouroboros_observer -> hirm in package

### 18:6 - CRASH during demo file updates
- Skipped per crash protocol

### 18:7-18:10 - Publication Preparation
- [DONE] Assessed publication folder structure
- [DONE] Searched project knowledge for paper strategy
- [DONE] Created Paper_2_Quantum_Classical/PAPER_2_OUTLINE.md
- [DONE] Created Paper_3_Temporal_Persistence/PAPER_3_OUTLINE.md

## THREE-PAPER PUBLICATION STRATEGY

| Paper | Focus | Status | Target Journal |
|-------|-------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Brain Criticality | Has content (6 source files) | Nature Rev Neuro |
| 2 | Quantum-Classical Bridge (SRID) | OUTLINE CREATED | Physics of Life Reviews |
| 3 | Temporal Persistence (Identity) | OUTLINE CREATED | Consciousness & Cognition |

---

## KEY DECISIONS

1. **Skipped demo file package rename** - Low priority given scipy crash prevention
2. **Pivoted to publication work** - Most valuable use of session time
3. **Created comprehensive outlines** - Ready for draft development

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Develop Paper 2 drafts (Sections 2 & 4 priority)
2. Develop Paper 3 drafts (Sections 3 & 5 priority)  
3. Assess Paper 1 folder content for consolidation
4. Fix code when Python execution enabled
5. Empirical validation with Sleep-EDF data

## LAYMAN SUMMARY

**What we did:** Created detailed outlines for two scientific papers.

**Paper 2 (Quantum-Classical Bridge):** Explains how consciousness connects the tiny quantum world to our everyday experience. The key idea is "Self-Reference-Induced Decoherence" - when a brain becomes complex enough to model itself completely, it triggers a phase transition from quantum to classical behavior. This is why we experience a definite reality instead of quantum fuzziness.

**Paper 3 (Identity Persistence):** Explains how "you" remain "you" even after sleep, anesthesia, or brain injury. Information about your identity is stored in structures that survive major state changes - like how a song's melody persists even when played on different instruments. This explains why people can wake from comas and still be themselves.

**Why it matters:** These outlines provide the roadmap for turning 25+ years of research into peer-reviewed publications that could advance consciousness science.
