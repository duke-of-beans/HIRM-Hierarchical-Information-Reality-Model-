# SESSION 26 SUMMARY
## Paper 1 Expansion Work
## Date: 2025-12-20
## Status: MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETE

---

## SESSION OBJECTIVES
1. Expand Paper 1 condensed draft from ~6,100 to ~18,000 words

## WORD COUNT PROGRESS

| Component | Words |
|-----------|-------|
| Original Paper 1 v3 | ~6,100 |
| Section 2 expansion | +~1,700 |
| Section 3 expansion | +~2,800 |
| Section 7 expansion | +~2,000 |
| **Estimated Total** | **~12,600** |
| Target | 18,000 |
| Remaining | ~5,400 |

Note: Some content in expanded sections overlaps with original, 
so net additions are less than raw expansion word counts.

---

## KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

### Empirical Evidence Systematized
- 50+ studies cited with specific findings
