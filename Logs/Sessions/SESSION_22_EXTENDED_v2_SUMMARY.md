## LITERATURE SYNTHESIS RESULTS

### 1. Disorders of Consciousness
- PCI* = 0.31 is empirical consciousness threshold
- 92% sensitivity for MCS detection
- 36% of UWS patients show covert consciousness capacity
- Validated across wakefulness, sleep, anesthesia, DOC

### 2. Psychedelic States
- LSD/psilocybin INCREASE brain entropy above normal wakefulness
- Fractal dimension increases = criticality evolution
- "Primary states" = higher entropy + criticality than secondary
- Proposal: Use psychedelics to treat disorders of consciousness
- DMN decoupling associated with ego dissolution

### 3. Developmental Consciousness
- Thalamocortical connections form by 26 weeks gestation
- Sleep-wake distinctions by 30 weeks
- Complexity reduction in anesthetized infants (0-3 years) confirmed
- Alpha rhythm: 8 Hz by age 3
- Theory of Mind correlates with network complexity increase

### 4. Anesthesia Hysteresis (Quantitative)
- LOR at higher propofol Ce than ROR
- ~1 µg/ml hysteresis gap
- "Neural inertia cannot be solely explained by pharmacokinetics"
- Supports bistability mechanism

## DOCUMENTS CREATED/UPDATED

1. LITERATURE_SYNTHESIS_SESSION_22_EXTENDED_v2.md (268 lines)
2. BUILD_STATUS.md updated
3. This session summary

---

## REMAINING GAPS

1. Direct C(t) = Phi x R x D computation unperformed
2. Map PCI*=0.31 to C_critical=8.3 bits dimensionally
3. Component independence (Phi-R-D correlations) empirically unknown
4. Hysteresis ratio comparison: HIRM predicts 1.3-1.5x

---

## NEXT SESSION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Option A: Computational Validation (if scipy available locally)
- Run consciousness_measure.py on Sleep-EDF data
- Compute actual C(t) values across sleep stages
- Test 8.3 bit threshold empirically

### Option B: Continue Literature Synthesis
- Cross-species comparative studies
- Meditation/contemplative states
- Brain lesion case studies

### Option C: Paper Refinement
- Update three papers with new citations
- Add quantitative threshold table to Paper 1
- Strengthen empirical validation section
