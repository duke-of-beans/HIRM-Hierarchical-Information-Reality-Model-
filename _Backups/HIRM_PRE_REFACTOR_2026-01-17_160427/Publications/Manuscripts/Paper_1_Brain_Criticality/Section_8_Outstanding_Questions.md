# PAPER 1 - SECTION 8: OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS

## 8. Outstanding Questions and Research Priorities

### 8.1 Local-to-Global Criticality: The Control Problem

A fundamental question persists: **How do local neural processes generate global critical dynamics without centralized control?**

The challenge:
- Each neuron follows local rules (threshold, refractory, plasticity)
- No neuron "knows" the global branching ratio
- Yet the system collectively maintains sigma ~ 1.0

Partial answers exist:
- Synaptic depression provides local negative feedback
- Homeostatic plasticity adjusts gains over longer timescales
- Network topology constrains possible dynamics

But a complete mechanistic account is lacking. We don't understand:
- How local mechanisms coordinate across distant regions
- What role neuromodulation plays in criticality maintenance
- Whether criticality is actively maintained or passively emerges

### 8.2 Which Dynamical Modes Support Consciousness?

Criticality enables many dynamical patterns. Which specifically support consciousness?

**The Ketamine Puzzle (Partially Resolved):**
Ketamine preserves criticality and consciousness - but which aspects of critical dynamics?
- Power-law avalanches: Preserved
- LRTC: Preserved
- Lyapunov exponent: Near zero
- Yet motor output is disconnected

This suggests criticality supports internal conscious processing while behavioral responsiveness depends on additional factors (motor pathway integrity, executive control).

**The DMT Challenge:**
DMT may shift certain criticality measures while preserving (or enhancing) consciousness. Either:
- DMT alters the type of critical dynamics, or
- Current measures don't capture all relevant dimensions, or
- Consciousness can persist with altered criticality under some conditions

### 8.3 Computational Tractability Challenges

Current consciousness measures face scalability limits:

**IIT's Phi:**
- O(2^n) computational complexity
- Tractable only for ~10 elements
- Human brain has ~10^11 neurons

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Coarse-graining approaches (mesoscale Phi)
- Approximation algorithms
- Surrogate measures (PCI, criticality markers)

**HIRM Advantages:**
- C = Phi x R x D may be approximated at mesoscale
- Each component has operational definition
- Criticality measures provide Phi proxy
- Self-reference measures (metacognition tasks) proxy R

### 8.4 Research Priorities

**Short-Term (1-3 years):**
1. Standardize criticality measurement protocols across labs
2. Develop self-reference (R factor) operational measures
3. Test HIRM predictions in anesthesia/DOC populations
4. Validate 7+/-2 component prediction

**Medium-Term (3-7 years):**
5. Develop closed-loop criticality modulation systems
6. Test cross-species predictions
7. Integrate criticality with neuroimaging multimodal approaches
8. Clinical trials for criticality-guided interventions

**Long-Term (7-15 years):**
9. Mechanistic understanding of local-to-global criticality
10. Artificial systems meeting C > C_critical
11. Resolution of consciousness-criticality sufficiency question
12. Integration with quantum biology findings
