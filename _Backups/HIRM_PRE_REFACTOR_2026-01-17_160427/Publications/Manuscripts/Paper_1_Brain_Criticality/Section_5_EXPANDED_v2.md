# PAPER 1 - SECTION 5: WHY CRITICALITY MATTERS FOR CONSCIOUSNESS (EXPANDED)

## 5. Why Criticality Matters for Consciousness

The preceding empirical evidence establishes that consciousness correlates with critical brain dynamics. But correlation is not explanation. This section addresses the deeper question: why should criticality be necessary for consciousness? We argue that criticality provides the computational substrate upon which consciousness can emerge, while demonstrating through component dissociation evidence that criticality alone is insufficient.

### 5.1 Optimal Information Processing at the Edge of Chaos

Criticality provides computational advantages essential for conscious experience through three convergent mechanisms.

**Maximized Dynamic Range.** Kinouchi and Copelli (2006) proved mathematically that critical networks achieve maximal dynamic range—the ability to respond distinctly to inputs spanning many orders of magnitude. At the critical point, weak signals receive amplification sufficient for detection while strong signals avoid saturation, preserving discriminability. Critical networks achieve dynamic ranges spanning 6-8 orders of magnitude compared to approximately 2 orders for subcritical networks. For consciousness, this enables simultaneous processing of subtle sensory gradients and intense stimuli without information loss.

**Maximized Information Transmission.** Shew et al. (2011) demonstrated that mutual information between network input and output peaks precisely at criticality. Subcritical networks attenuate signals excessively, while supercritical networks introduce noise through runaway activity. Only at criticality does the signal-to-noise ratio optimize for faithful information transmission across neural populations. Beggs and Plenz (2003) showed this optimization enables information propagation across cortical networks without either dying out (subcritical) or exploding (supercritical).

**Maximized Information Storage.** Haldeman and Beggs (2005) established that memory capacity—the number of distinct patterns a network can reliably store and retrieve—peaks at criticality. Critical networks maintain more distinct attractor states with more reliable pattern completion. This capacity is essential for consciousness, which requires maintaining coherent representations across time and integrating current input with stored context.

The convergence of these three optimizations at a single operating point suggests criticality is not merely beneficial but may be mathematically necessary for the kind of information processing consciousness requires.

### 5.2 The Integration-Segregation Balance

Conscious experience exhibits a paradoxical requirement: simultaneous integration (unified experience across modalities) and segregation (distinct processing of different information streams). You experience the world as unified while retaining awareness of distinct components—the visual scene, the auditory background, the proprioceptive sense of your body. Criticality uniquely enables this balance.

**Subcritical dynamics** produce excessive segregation. Activity remains local, modules operate independently, and no mechanism exists for creating unified experience. The brain in deep anesthesia (sigma approximately 0.85) exemplifies this regime—isolated islands of activity with no global coordination.

**Supercritical dynamics** produce excessive integration verging on chaos. Activity spreads everywhere, all modules conflate, and distinct content cannot be maintained. Seizure states (sigma greater than 1.10) demonstrate this regime—hypersynchronous activity that destroys informational differentiation.

**Critical dynamics** achieve flexible balance. Activity can spread globally when integration is needed or remain local when segregation is needed. This "metastability"—the ability to visit multiple configurations without becoming trapped—characterizes conscious brain dynamics. Deco et al. (2017) showed that metastability peaks at criticality, providing the dynamical repertoire for rich conscious content.

The integration-segregation balance corresponds mathematically to maximizing the product of integrated information (Phi) and differentiation (D). Neither extreme optimizes this product: pure integration eliminates differentiation (D approaches 1), while pure segregation eliminates integration (Phi approaches component sum). Only at criticality does the brain achieve the multiplicative optimization that consciousness requires.

### 5.3 Criticality Enables But Does Not Constitute Consciousness

Here we confront a crucial distinction with profound implications for consciousness theory. Criticality is necessary but not sufficient for consciousness. Multiple lines of evidence establish this insufficiency.

**In Vitro Preparations.** Cortical slices and organoid cultures exhibit power-law avalanche distributions indistinguishable from those recorded in conscious brains (Beggs & Plenz, 2003, 2004). Yet no plausible argument suggests these preparations are conscious. Criticality emerges from network dynamics independent of conscious experience.

**The Ketamine Dissociation.** Maschke et al. (2024) demonstrated that ketamine preserves near-critical dynamics (branching ratio approximately 0.98, unchanged from baseline) while producing dissociative anesthesia. Subjects under ketamine report vivid dream-like consciousness despite behavioral unresponsiveness. Criticality and consciousness are preserved together—supporting necessity—but this preservation occurs in a state dramatically altered from normal consciousness, indicating additional factors shape conscious content.

**The DMT Paradox.** Irrmischer et al. (2025) found DMT shifts dynamics toward subcritical despite intensified subjective experience. However, this apparent contradiction may reflect measurement limitations rather than theoretical failure. DMT states may involve altered criticality topology—preserved in some networks, disrupted in others—rather than global subcriticality.

**The Sufficiency Reductio.** If criticality alone were sufficient for consciousness, any critical system would be conscious. Sandpiles at their angle of repose, forest fires at percolation threshold, and computer networks tuned to criticality all exhibit critical dynamics. The implausibility of consciousness in these systems demonstrates that criticality provides necessary computational substrate without being sufficient for consciousness itself.

### 5.4 Component Dissociation Evidence: The Zero-Multiplier Theorem

HIRM proposes that consciousness requires the product C(t) = Phi(t) x R(t) x D(t) to exceed a critical threshold. The multiplicative structure makes a distinctive prediction: if any component reaches zero, consciousness should disappear regardless of the other components' values. This "zero-multiplier theorem" distinguishes HIRM from additive theories and generates testable predictions.

**Meditation Cessation Evidence.** Sacchet et al. (2025) studied experienced meditators achieving cessation states (nirodha-samapatti)—complete temporary suspension of conscious experience. EEG analysis revealed that during cessation, Lempel-Ziv complexity (Phi proxy) remained elevated while self-referential processing (R proxy) dropped to near-zero. The multiplicative prediction held: high Phi x zero R = zero consciousness. This validates the zero-multiplier theorem under controlled conditions.

**Autism Spectrum Dissociation.** ASD presents altered consciousness profiles consistent with component-specific disruption. Integration (Phi) shows local over-connectivity paired with long-range under-connectivity. Self-reference (R) shows theory-of-mind difficulties. Dimensional complexity (D) shows sensory hyper-reactivity (elevated D in some domains). The heterogeneous ASD phenotype reflects varying patterns of component disruption rather than uniform consciousness reduction—precisely as HIRM's multiplicative structure predicts.

**Developmental Trajectories.** Rett syndrome demonstrates consciousness regression—a trajectory unique among developmental disorders. Initial normal development (all components adequate) gives way to progressive deterioration. HIRM predicts this regression reflects component-by-component degradation, with consciousness collapsing when any component crosses below threshold. Longitudinal measurement could test whether regression correlates with specific component failure.

### 5.5 What Criticality Provides: The Self-Reference Completion Mechanism

Criticality is necessary because only at the critical point can the three consciousness components achieve their required values simultaneously:

First, only at criticality can information integrate globally, maximizing Phi. Subcritical dynamics fragment information processing; supercritical dynamics destroy informational differentiation.

Second, only at criticality can self-referential loops close completely. The recursive processing required for R approaching 1.0 demands that activity patterns can reverberate through the system without dying out or exploding—a property unique to critical dynamics.

Third, only at criticality do fluctuations enable the phase transitions that trigger consciousness emergence. The susceptibility divergence at criticality means small changes in C(t) can produce dramatic state transitions—explaining the sharp boundary between conscious and unconscious states.

But criticality is insufficient because the architecture must support self-reference completion (R approaching 1.0 requires specific circuit topology), dimensional complexity (D requires sufficient degrees of freedom in neural state space), and multiplicative threshold crossing (C = Phi x R x D greater than C_critical requires all factors to be non-zero and sufficiently large).

**Falsifiable Predictions:**

1. Systems with critical dynamics but no self-referential architecture (R = 0) should lack consciousness regardless of Phi and D values
2. Meditation cessation should show preserved Phi with collapsed R, producing zero C(t)
3. Component-specific interventions should produce multiplicative (not additive) effects on consciousness measures
4. Developmental disorders should show component-specific profiles predicting consciousness alterations

The next section develops how HIRM formally addresses this sufficiency gap through precise mathematical specification of the consciousness threshold.
