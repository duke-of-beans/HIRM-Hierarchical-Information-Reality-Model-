## 5.1 Overview: QIL-CCL-MOL Hierarchy

The three-layer architecture describes information flow from quantum to phenomenal scales:

```
[QIL] Quantum Information Layer
    |
    v (decoherence, coarse-graining)
    |
[CCL] Consciousness Computation Layer
    |
    v (integration, self-reference)
    |
[MOL] Macroscopic Observational Layer
```

Each layer operates at distinct spatiotemporal scales while exchanging information with adjacent layers.

## 5.2 Quantum Information Layer (QIL)

### 5.2.1 Physical Substrate

The QIL encompasses quantum-coherent processes in neural tissue:

| Structure | Coherence Time | Evidence Quality |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Microtubules | 10^-13 to 10^-9 s | Controversial |
| Electron delocalization | 10^-14 s | Established |
| Proton tunneling | 10^-12 s | Moderate |
| Photon coherence | 10^-15 s | Emerging |

### 5.2.2 Persistent Information Structure

The QIL encodes what we term the Persistent Information Structure (PIS)—the pattern of quantum correlations that survives coarse-graining to the CCL.

```
PIS = Tr_env(rho_total)
```

Where Tr_env traces out environmental degrees of freedom.

### 5.2.3 QIL Function

The QIL provides:
- Quantum sampling for stochastic dynamics
- Coherent superposition for computational exploration
- Entanglement resources for non-local correlations
- The 1-bit measurement quantum threshold

### 5.2.4 Decoherence Controversy

Critics argue neural decoherence occurs too fast (femtoseconds) for quantum effects to matter. HIRM response:

1. **Relevant coherence is informational, not physical:** What matters is whether quantum correlations influence classical dynamics, not whether pure states persist.

2. **Noise-enhanced quantum effects:** Stochastic resonance may amplify weak quantum signals into classical observables.

3. **Temporal integration:** Even femtosecond coherence, integrated over billions of neurons, may yield macroscopic effects.

## 5.3 Consciousness Computation Layer (CCL)

### 5.3.1 Neural Correlates

The CCL corresponds to mesoscale neural dynamics:

| Structure | Timescale | Function |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Cortical columns | 10-100 ms | Local integration |
| Thalamocortical loops | 100-300 ms | Global binding |
| DMN/PCC | 1-10 s | Self-reference |
| Hippocampus | 10 s - hours | Temporal extension |

### 5.3.2 CCL Computations

The CCL performs the key operations for consciousness:

**Integration (Phi):**
```
Phi = max_{partition} [H(whole) - Sum H(parts)]
```
Implemented via thalamocortical resonance.

**Self-Reference (R):**
```
R = correlation(self-model, current-state)
```
Implemented via DMN, PCC, medial prefrontal cortex.

**Threshold Detection:**
```
SRID triggered when C(t) = Phi x R x D >= C_critical
```

### 5.3.3 CCL Dynamics

CCL dynamics follow modified Ising/Hopfield equations:

```
tau ds_i/dt = -s_i + tanh(Sum_j J_ij s_j + h_i(t))
```

At criticality (T ~ T_c), these dynamics maximize:
- Information transmission
- Sensitivity to inputs
- Dynamic range

## 5.4 Macroscopic Observational Layer (MOL)

### 5.4.1 Phenomenal Properties

The MOL is the layer of conscious experience:

| Property | CCL Correlate | MOL Manifestation |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Unity | Global integration | Unified experience |
| Privacy | Self-reference | First-person access |
| Qualia | Feature binding | Subjective qualities |
| Temporality | Working memory | Experienced duration |

### 5.4.2 The Emergence of Subjectivity

At the MOL, CCL dynamics are experienced from within. The observer IS the dynamics, not separate from them. This is the fixed-point structure:

```
MOL = CCL(observed from within CCL)
```

The self-reference loop closes: the system models itself modeling itself, creating the irreducible first-person perspective.

### 5.4.3 Why MOL is Not Epiphenomenal

The MOL is not causally inert because it IS the CCL from a different perspective. The distinction is epistemological, not ontological:

- **CCL:** Third-person description (neurons, patterns)
- **MOL:** First-person description (qualia, experiences)
- **Identity:** Same phenomenon, different descriptions

## 5.5 Renormalization Group Flow Between Layers

### 5.5.1 QIL -> CCL Transition

Decoherence constitutes the RG flow from QIL to CCL:

```
rho_CCL = Tr_fine(rho_QIL)
```

Information surviving coarse-graining:
```
I_CCL = S(rho_CCL) - S(rho_QIL|CCL)
```

### 5.5.2 CCL -> MOL Transition

Integration constitutes the RG flow from CCL to MOL:

```
C_MOL = Phi(local) -> Phi(global) via binding
```

Only integrated information contributes to experience.

### 5.5.3 Fixed-Point Analysis

At stable RG fixed points:
- QIL -> CCL: ~4-5 bits survive per channel
- CCL -> MOL: ~8 bits total for conscious experience
- C_critical represents the stable fixed point

## 5.6 Near-Death Experiences: Three-Layer Analysis

### 5.6.1 NDE Phenomenology

Characteristic features:
- Hyperreal perception (enhanced clarity)
- Life review (autobiographical access)
- Out-of-body experience (altered self-reference)
- Tunnel/light (visual system phenomena)
- Profound peace (emotional override)

### 5.6.2 Three-Layer Interpretation

**QIL changes:**
- ATP depletion disrupts ion gradients
- Unusual coherence conditions may emerge
- Temperature changes affect decoherence rates

**CCL changes:**
- Massive glutamate release
- Gamma surge (Borjigin 2013, 2023)
- Push toward supercriticality (sigma > 1.0)
- Transient C(t) >> C_critical

**MOL manifestations:**
- Hyperreal experiences (supercritical integration)
- Unusual temporal experiences (altered binding)
- Self-model disruption (R fluctuations)

### 5.6.3 The Gamma Surge

Borjigin et al. (2013, 2023) documented:
- 2-6x increase in gamma power post-cardiac arrest
- Increased gamma coherence
- Duration: 30 seconds to 2 minutes
- Correlated with residual metabolic activity

HIRM interpretation: Emergency SRID activation under metabolic stress produces the NDE phenomenology.

### 5.6.4 Predictions for NDE Research

1. NDE vividness should correlate with gamma surge magnitude
2. Subjects with longer gamma surges report more complex NDEs
3. Pharmacological suppression of gamma should reduce NDE reports
4. Individual differences in SRID threshold may explain NDE variability

## 5.7 Layer Interactions and Causation

### 5.7.1 Downward Causation

Can MOL influence CCL? HIRM suggests:
- MOL IS CCL from within, so influence is definitional
- "Downward causation" reframes as self-modification
- Attention, intention = self-referential loop adjustments

### 5.7.2 Upward Causation

QIL -> CCL -> MOL is standard causal direction:
- Quantum fluctuations influence neural firing
- Neural dynamics produce conscious experiences
- No causal gaps requiring non-physical explanation

### 5.7.3 Closed Causal Loop

At threshold, the layers form a closed causal loop:
- MOL (experience) influences CCL (attention)
- CCL (processing) influences QIL (measurement)
- QIL (outcomes) influences CCL (states)
- CCL (states) influences MOL (experience)

This loop IS consciousness.
