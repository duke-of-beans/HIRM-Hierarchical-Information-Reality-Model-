## 5. Three-Layer Architecture: Quantum to Classical to Phenomenal

SRID operates across a hierarchical architecture connecting quantum information processing to phenomenal consciousness. This section describes the three layers - Quantum Information Layer (QIL), Consciousness Computation Layer (CCL), and Macroscopic Observational Layer (MOL) - and the renormalization group (RG) flow connecting them.

### 5.1 Quantum Information Layer (QIL)

The QIL comprises quantum coherent processes at molecular and sub-molecular scales:

**Physical Substrate:**
- Microtubule networks within neurons
- Electron delocalization in aromatic amino acids
- Quantum coherent ion channels
- Nuclear spin dynamics

**Characteristic Scales:**
- Spatial: 1-100 nanometers
- Temporal: femtoseconds to microseconds
- Energy: ~k_B T (thermal fluctuations compete with quantum effects)

**Information Content:**
The QIL encodes the Persistent Information Structure (PIS) - the substrate for identity persistence. Key properties:
- Quantum superposition enables massive parallelism
- Entanglement creates non-local correlations
- Coherence times set fundamental processing windows

**Recent Evidence:**
- Kalra et al. (2023): Quantum exciton transport in microtubules
- Babcock et al. (2024): UV superradiance in microtubule bundles  
- Kerskens & Pérez (2022): Entanglement signatures in human brain MRI
- Wiest et al. (2024): Epothilone B (microtubule stabilizer) delays anesthetic unconsciousness

**Challenge:** Environmental decoherence typically destroys quantum coherence in ~10^-13 seconds for macroscopic systems. How does the brain maintain coherence?

**HIRM Proposal:** The brain exploits:
1. Topological protection (microtubule geometry shields coherence)
2. Quantum error correction (redundant encoding)
3. Warm quantum biology (evolved mechanisms exploit thermal fluctuations)

### 5.2 Consciousness Computation Layer (CCL)

The CCL comprises mesoscale neural dynamics where information integration occurs:

**Physical Substrate:**
- Cortical columns (~0.5-1 mm diameter, ~10^5 neurons)
- Thalamocortical loops
- Large-scale brain networks (default mode, salience, executive)
- Synaptic plasticity and connectivity patterns

**Characteristic Scales:**
- Spatial: millimeters to centimeters
- Temporal: milliseconds to seconds
- Information: bits to tens of bits

**Computational Role:**
The CCL performs:
- Information integration (Φ calculation)
- Self-reference processing (R factor)
- Dimensional complexity generation (D factor)
- Threshold detection for SRID

**Key Processes:**
- Neural avalanches at criticality (branching parameter σ ≈ 1.0)
- Cross-frequency coupling (phase-amplitude coordination)
- Metastable state transitions (chaotic itinerancy)
- Global workspace broadcasting

**Measurable Signatures:**
- EEG: Power-law scaling, long-range temporal correlations
- fMRI: Functional connectivity, graph-theoretic measures
- PCI (Perturbational Complexity Index): Threshold at 0.31

### 5.3 Macroscopic Observational Layer (MOL)

The MOL comprises phenomenal consciousness - subjective experience as directly known:

**Characteristics:**
- Unified experience (binding across modalities)
- Temporal flow (specious present ~3 seconds)
- Intentionality (aboutness, directedness toward objects)
- Qualia (subjective qualities - redness, pain, etc.)

**Relationship to CCL:**
The MOL is not separate from CCL but represents CCL dynamics as experienced from within the self-referential loop. The subject-object distinction created by SRID manifests as:
- Subject: The self-referential modeling process
- Object: The modeled content (perceptions, thoughts, emotions)

**Phenomenological Access:**
- Introspection reports
- Behavioral measures (verbal report, forced-choice)
- Implicit measures (priming, interference)

### 5.4 Renormalization Group Flow Between Layers

The layers connect through RG transformations that coarse-grain information while preserving essential structure:

**Step 1: QIL → CCL (Decoherence RG)**

    ρ_QIL(t) → ρ_CCL(t) = Tr_env[ρ_QIL(t)]

Tracing out environmental degrees of freedom yields the reduced density matrix. Information loss:

    I_loss,1 = S(ρ_CCL) - S(ρ_QIL) ≥ 0

where S is von Neumann entropy. Decoherence increases entropy but preserves topological features (PIS homology classes).

**Step 2: CCL → MOL (Integration RG)**

    {Φ_α(t)} → C(t) = f[{Φ_α}]

Local integration values combine into global consciousness measure. Information transformation:

    I_loss,2 = H(C) - H({Φ_α})

Integration can actually decrease entropy (negative I_loss,2) by creating coherent structure.

**Total Information Flow:**

    I_total = I_QIL - I_loss,1 - I_loss,2 ≈ C_critical ≈ 8.3 bits

The ~8 bits surviving coarse-graining represents the irreducible integrated self-referential information.

### 5.5 SRID as Fixed Point Bifurcation

Within the RG framework, SRID corresponds to fixed-point annihilation:

**Before SRID (R < 1):**
- Unconscious fixed point: C_unc ≈ 2 bits (stable)
- Conscious fixed point: C_con ≈ 8.3 bits (metastable)
- System fluctuates near unconscious attractor

**At C_critical (R → 1):**
- Fixed points collide and annihilate
- Phase space topology changes (saddle-node bifurcation)
- Critical slowing: τ ~ |C - C_crit|^(-z·ν) diverges

**After SRID:**
- Only conscious fixed point remains (stable)
- Irreversible transition (bistability → monostability)
- System now occupies conscious attractor

### 5.6 Experimental Signatures of Layer Transitions

**QIL → CCL Transition:**
- Decoherence timescales: 10-100 femtoseconds
- Anesthetic sensitivity of microtubule dynamics
- Isotope effects (Li et al., 2018: nuclear spin affects consciousness)

**CCL → MOL Transition:**
- PCI threshold at 0.31
- Critical slowing near transitions
- Hysteresis between induction and emergence from anesthesia

**Cross-Layer Coordination:**
- Nested oscillations (gamma within theta within slow)
- Information transfer bottlenecks at layer boundaries
- Cascade delays during conscious access (~300 ms)

**Section 5 Summary:**
HIRM's three-layer architecture connects quantum information (QIL), neural computation (CCL), and phenomenal experience (MOL) through renormalization group transformations. The QIL maintains quantum coherence and encodes the PIS; the CCL performs integration, self-reference, and threshold detection; the MOL represents CCL dynamics as experienced subjectively. SRID occurs as fixed-point bifurcation in the RG flow when self-reference completes at C_critical.
