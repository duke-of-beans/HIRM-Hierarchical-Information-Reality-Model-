# PAPER 2 - SECTION 7: RELATIONSHIP TO COMPETING THEORIES

## 7. Relationship to Competing Theories

SRID does not seek to replace existing consciousness theories but to integrate and extend them. This section positions SRID within the theoretical landscape.

### 7.1 Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

**IIT Core Claims:**
- Consciousness IS integrated information (Φ)
- Φ quantifies irreducible cause-effect structure
- Every system has some Φ (panpsychism)
- No threshold; consciousness is continuous with Φ

**SRID Relationship:**
- **Shared:** Φ as key measure of integration
- **Different:** SRID requires Φ × R × D > threshold (not Φ alone)
- **Extended:** SRID explains WHY integration matters (enables SRID)

**Critical Test:** High-Φ systems without consciousness
- IIT: Impossible (high Φ = high consciousness)
- SRID: Possible if R < 1 (no self-reference)
- Example: Grid network with high Φ but no self-modeling capacity

**Empirical Status:** COGITATE adversarial collaboration (2025) found IIT's predictions only partially supported; explanatory gap remains for why integration produces experience.

### 7.2 Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW)

**GNW Core Claims:**
- Consciousness = global broadcasting
- Information becomes conscious when broadcast widely
- All-or-none access (threshold mechanism)
- Prefrontal-parietal network critical

**SRID Relationship:**
- **Shared:** Threshold mechanism, all-or-none character
- **Different:** Broadcasting necessary but not sufficient
- **Extended:** SRID explains WHY broadcasting creates consciousness (enables self-reference across network)

**Critical Test:** Broadcasting without consciousness
- GNW: Impossible (broadcasting = consciousness)
- SRID: Possible if broadcasted information lacks self-referential structure
- Example: Reflex arcs globally broadcast but unconscious

### 7.3 Higher-Order Thought (HOT) Theories

**HOT Core Claims:**
- Consciousness requires higher-order representation
- A mental state is conscious when represented by another state
- Self-reference (of a kind) is necessary
- Prefrontal cortex implements higher-order representation

**SRID Relationship:**
- **Shared:** Self-reference necessary for consciousness
- **Different:** SRID quantifies self-reference (R factor) and requires completion (R → 1)
- **Extended:** SRID explains WHY higher-order representation matters (triggers SRID)

**Critical Test:** Degree of self-reference matters
- HOT: Any higher-order representation sufficient
- SRID: Must approach completeness (R → 1)
- Implication: Partial self-modeling is insufficient

### 7.4 Predictive Processing / Free Energy Principle

**FEP Core Claims:**
- Brain minimizes free energy (prediction error)
- Consciousness relates to hierarchical predictive modeling
- Self-modeling as special case of world-modeling
- Continuous with life and cognition

**SRID Relationship:**
- **Shared:** Self-modeling central to consciousness
- **Different:** SRID requires complete self-modeling triggering phase transition
- **Extended:** FEP describes optimization; SRID explains threshold

**Integration:** FEP drives system toward states minimizing prediction error. When self-model becomes sufficiently accurate (R → 1), SRID triggers. FEP and SRID are complementary: FEP explains dynamics, SRID explains emergence.

### 7.5 Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR)

**Orch-OR Core Claims:**
- Quantum computations in microtubules
- Gravitational self-energy triggers objective collapse
- Collapse = moment of conscious experience
- Non-computable; explains human insight

**SRID Relationship:**
- **Shared:** Quantum processes in microtubules; collapse relevant
- **Different:** Collapse trigger (gravity vs. self-reference)
- **Advantage:** SRID doesn't require exotic physics; testable with current methods

**Critical Test:** Manipulate self-reference independently of mass
- Orch-OR: Collapse depends on mass/energy
- SRID: Collapse depends on information closure
- Example: Same microtubule mass, different self-reference levels

### 7.6 Attention Schema Theory (AST)

**AST Core Claims:**
- Consciousness is attention schema (model of attention)
- Brain constructs simplified model of its own attention
- Explains subjective qualities as modeled properties
- No hard problem; just modeling

**SRID Relationship:**
- **Shared:** Self-modeling central
- **Different:** SRID adds integration (Φ) and complexity (D) requirements
- **Extended:** AST describes what is modeled; SRID explains why modeling triggers emergence

### 7.7 Synthesis: HIRM as Meta-Framework

SRID positions within HIRM (Hierarchical Information-Reality Model) as a synthesis:

| Theory | Captures | Within HIRM |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| IIT | Integration (Φ) | CCL integration measure |
| GNW | Global broadcasting | MOL emergence mechanism |
| HOT | Self-reference (R) | Self-modeling component |
| FEP | Optimization dynamics | Drives toward C_critical |
| Orch-OR | Quantum substrate | QIL foundations |
| AST | Attention modeling | Content of R factor |

**Key Insight:** Each theory captures a necessary but insufficient component. HIRM unifies them through the multiplicative structure C = Φ × R × D, where each factor corresponds to valid theoretical insights.
