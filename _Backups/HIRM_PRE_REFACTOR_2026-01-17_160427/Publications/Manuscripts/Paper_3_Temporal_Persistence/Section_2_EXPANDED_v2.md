## 2. MULTI-SCALE TEMPORAL ARCHITECTURE

Understanding identity persistence requires grasping how consciousness unfolds across vastly different timescales - spanning 15 orders of magnitude from femtosecond quantum events to decades-long autobiographical narratives.

### 2.1 Quantum Timescales (10^-15 to 10^-6 seconds)

At the fastest timescales, quantum coherence and decoherence processes determine which information can survive to influence classical neural dynamics.

**Femtosecond Electronic Oscillations (10^-15 s):**
Electronic coherence in biological molecules decays within tens of femtoseconds. Gustin et al. (2023) measured ~30 fs coherence decay in DNA bases at physiological temperatures. This ultrafast regime sets fundamental limits on quantum information processing.

**Microtubule Coherence Windows (10^-13 to 10^-6 s):**
Microtubules show extended coherence times under certain conditions. Kalra et al. (2023) demonstrated electronic energy migration exceeding classical predictions, suggesting quantum effects may persist into the microsecond range in protected biological environments. This provides a potential substrate for quantum contributions to consciousness.

**Decoherence-Selected Pointer States:**
Within this timescale, environmental decoherence selects stable "pointer states" - the quantum states that will survive to influence classical dynamics. Identity information must be encoded in these selected states to achieve macroscopic persistence.

### 2.2 Neural Timescales (10^-3 to 1 second)

Classical neural processing operates across milliseconds to seconds, implementing the moment-to-moment computations underlying conscious experience.

**Action Potential Propagation (~1-10 ms):**
Individual spikes propagate along axons in milliseconds, enabling rapid information transfer across brain regions. This timescale sets the minimal grain of neural information processing.

**Gamma Oscillations (30-100 Hz, ~10-30 ms):**
High-frequency gamma oscillations bind distributed neural activity into coherent percepts. Each gamma cycle represents an elementary "snapshot" of integrated information - potentially corresponding to discrete moments of consciousness.

**Alpha Rhythms (8-12 Hz, ~100 ms):**
Alpha oscillations define broader integration windows, coordinating activity across cortical regions. This timescale matches the temporal resolution of conscious perception.

**The Specious Present (~3 seconds):**
William James' "specious present" - the experienced duration of "now" - spans approximately 3 seconds. This likely reflects the time constant of working memory integration and represents the fundamental temporal unit of conscious experience.

### 2.3 Cognitive Timescales (seconds to minutes)

Above the specious present, cognitive processes integrate information across longer durations.

**Working Memory (3-30 seconds):**
Working memory maintains information across delays through persistent neural activity. This capacity sets limits on conscious manipulation of information - the famous 7 +/- 2 items limitation reflects working memory constraints.

**Episodic Binding (seconds to minutes):**
Individual experiences are bound into coherent episodes through hippocampal-cortical interactions occurring over seconds to minutes. Failures at this timescale produce anterograde amnesia - inability to form new conscious memories.

### 2.4 Consolidation Timescales (hours to days)

Long-term memory formation requires consolidation processes unfolding across hours to days, largely during sleep.

**Sleep-Dependent Consolidation:**
During NREM sleep, information replays at compressed timescales, transferring from hippocampus to cortex. This process strengthens PIS encoding, explaining why sleep deprivation impairs identity stability and cognitive function.

**Synaptic Homeostasis:**
Tononi's synaptic homeostasis hypothesis proposes that sleep downscales synaptic weights while preserving relative differences. This maintains signal-to-noise ratio in identity encodings - effectively "cleaning" the PIS substrate.

**Schema Integration:**
Over days to weeks, new experiences integrate into existing schema structures. This slower process shapes the deep attractor basins that constitute core identity.

### 2.5 Lifespan Timescales (years to decades)

The longest timescales involve developmental emergence and lifelong identity maintenance.

**Developmental Emergence (months to years):**
Consciousness and identity emerge gradually through cortical maturation. The 18-24 month mirror self-recognition milestone marks the first clear evidence that C(t) has crossed C_critical and stable PIS has begun accumulating.

**Identity Refinement (years to decades):**
Throughout life, the PIS continues evolving - new experiences modify attractor landscapes while preserving core topological structure. This explains how we remain "the same person" despite profound psychological change.

### 2.6 Hierarchical Integration

The key insight is that CONTINUITY EMERGES FROM HIERARCHY. Each timescale provides the stable substrate for the next:

1. Quantum pointer states provide stable basis for neural coding
2. Neural oscillations provide temporal structure for cognitive binding
3. Cognitive binding provides content for consolidation
4. Consolidation provides long-term structure for identity

Identity persistence doesn't require continuous physical substrate - it requires information conservation across these discrete scale transitions. The PIS achieves this through redundant encoding that preserves essential structure even as specific implementations change.
