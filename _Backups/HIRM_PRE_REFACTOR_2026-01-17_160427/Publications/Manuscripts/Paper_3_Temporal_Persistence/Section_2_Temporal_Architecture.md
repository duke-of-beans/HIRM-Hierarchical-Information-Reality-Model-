# PAPER 3 - SECTION 2: MULTI-SCALE TEMPORAL ARCHITECTURE

## 2. Multi-Scale Temporal Architecture

Consciousness unfolds across 15 orders of magnitude in time - from femtosecond quantum events to lifelong memories. Understanding identity persistence requires mapping this temporal hierarchy.

### 2.1 Quantum Timescales (10^-15 to 10^-6 seconds)

**Femtosecond Dynamics:**
Electron oscillations in aromatic amino acids occur at ~10^-15 s. These may support quantum coherent processing before environmental decoherence intervenes.

**Microtubule Coherence (10^-13 to 10^-10 s):**
Sergi et al. (2025) model quantum-classical transitions in microtubules, showing coherent exciton transport persisting for 100-1000 femtoseconds at physiological temperatures.

**Discrete Orch-OR Events (~10^-6 s):**
Penrose-Hameroff propose conscious moments arise from objective reduction events, each lasting microseconds and creating "frames" of experience stitched into continuous flow.

**Identity Implication:** Quantum-level information may encode aspects of identity protected by topological features of the microtubule network.

### 2.2 Neural Timescales (10^-3 to 10^0 seconds)

**Action Potentials (~1 ms):**
Individual neural spikes last ~1 ms. Information is encoded in spike timing, rate, and population patterns.

**Gamma Oscillations (30-100 Hz, 10-30 ms):**
Gamma rhythms coordinate local neural populations. Binding of features into unified percepts occurs at gamma frequencies.

**Alpha Rhythms (8-12 Hz, ~100 ms):**
Alpha cycles may represent discrete "windows" of processing. Each cycle samples the environment and updates internal models.

**Specious Present (~3 s):**
Psychological research suggests a ~3 second window of "now" - the duration over which events feel simultaneous. This integrates across faster timescales.

### 2.3 Cognitive Timescales (10^0 to 10^2 seconds)

**Working Memory (3-30 s):**
Active maintenance of information for ongoing tasks. Limited capacity (7±2 items) reflects CCL constraints.

**Episodic Encoding (seconds to minutes):**
Experiences become memories through hippocampal processing. Initial encoding is labile; consolidation stabilizes.

### 2.4 Consolidation Timescales (10^3 to 10^6 seconds)

**Sleep-Dependent Consolidation (hours):**
NREM sleep replays recent experiences, transferring information from hippocampus to neocortex. This reorganizes CCL while preserving PIS.

**Synaptic Homeostasis (hours to days):**
Tononi's SHY hypothesis: waking strengthens synapses; sleep downscales globally, preserving relative differences (information) while managing resources.

**Schema Integration (days to weeks):**
New information integrates with existing knowledge structures. Memories transform but identity-relevant core persists.

### 2.5 Hierarchical Integration

**The Continuity Paradox:**
Each timescale involves discrete events: quantum jumps, action potentials, gamma cycles, sleep episodes. Yet experience feels continuous. How?

**Nested Hierarchy Resolution:**
Continuity emerges from nested discrete processes:
- Fast timescales (quantum, neural) provide substrate
- Intermediate timescales (cognitive) integrate into episodes  
- Slow timescales (consolidation) preserve across transitions

Information flows upward through integration, downward through modulation. The PIS represents invariants preserved across all timescales - the structure that remains when everything else changes.

**Critical Insight:** Identity persistence doesn't require continuous physical substrate. It requires information conservation across discrete state transitions, analogous to how a river maintains identity despite water constantly flowing through.
