## TIER 1: NEAR-TERM TESTABLE RESEARCH (1-5 Years)

### R1. Observer Symmetry Breaking & Phenomenal Charge

**Core Hypothesis:** Consciousness onset is spontaneous symmetry breaking producing conserved "phenomenal charge" - a gauge-theoretic order parameter.

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Every force in physics derives from symmetry + charge (EM ↔ U(1) × electric charge)
- HIRM treats consciousness as phase transition with self-reference at criticality
- Predicts: symmetry breaking at C_critical generates new conserved quantity

**Key Predictions:**
1. **Phenomenal charge conservation:** Two conscious systems cannot merge unless phase-aligned
2. **Hysteresis:** Consciousness transitions show path-dependence characteristic of broken symmetry
3. **Order parameter:** Frontoparietal coherence vs DMN suppression behaves like Higgs field
4. **Context invariance:** Order parameter robust across different conscious contents

**Experimental Protocol:**
```
Phase 1: Identify Bifurcation Events
- High-density EEG during conscious access tasks (Sergent 250-700ms paradigm)
- Simultaneous fMRI for network-level dynamics
- Identify exact moment of conscious ignition

Phase 2: Compute Order Parameters
- Frontoparietal phase coherence (Φ_FP)
- DMN suppression index (S_DMN)
- Cross-frequency coupling strength (C_CFC)
- Test: Does composite order parameter show discontinuous jump?

Phase 3: Test Hysteresis
- Vary stimulus intensity bidirectionally (increasing vs decreasing)
- Predict: Different thresholds for conscious access depending on direction
- Quantify hysteresis width: ΔΦ = Φ_up - Φ_down

Phase 4: Test Merger Impossibility
- Hypnotic rapport / deep empathy / couple therapy sessions
- Two-person fMRI ("hyperscanning")

```

**Success Criteria:**

### R2. Phenomenal Inertia & State Resistance

**Core Hypothesis:** Consciousness exhibits inertia - resistance to state changes proportional to attractor basin depth. Different conscious states have different "phenomenal mass."

**Theoretical Framework:**
```
Phenomenal momentum: p_φ = m_φ × v_φ

Where:
  m_φ = attractor basin depth (stability)
  v_φ = rate of phenomenal content change
  
Conservation: p_φ conserved during continuous state evolution
Impulse: Δp_φ = F_φ × Δt (perturbation force × duration)
```

**Key Predictions:**
1. **Deep meditation = high m_φ:** Resistant to perturbation, requires more TMS energy to disrupt
2. **Psychedelics = low m_φ:** Rapid phenomenal transitions, low perturbation threshold
3. **Trauma states = artificially high m_φ:** Hard to exit flashback attractor
4. **State-dependent learning:** Memory access optimal when p_φ(encoding) ≈ p_φ(retrieval)

**Experimental Protocol:**
```
Phase 1: Measure Perturbation Resistance
- TMS pulses of varying intensity during:
  * Meditation (novice vs expert, shallow vs deep)
  * Psychedelic states (LSD/psilocybin, dose-dependent)
  * PTSD flashback vs normal memory retrieval
  * Normal waking baseline
  
- Outcome: Minimum TMS intensity to disrupt ongoing state
- Predict: P_resist ∝ (PCI)² × (dwell_time)^α

Phase 2: Measure State Transition Dynamics  
- Rapid state switching paradigms (attention shifts, emotional shifts)
- High-temporal-resolution EEG (1000 Hz+)
- Quantify: Time constant τ for transitions
- Predict: τ ∝ m_φ (high-inertia states transition slower)

Phase 3: Test Conservation Law
- Continuous phenomenal report during gradual state changes
- Measure: phenomenal content velocity (Δcontent/Δt)
- Predict: When external forcing stops, system continues in direction of momentum

Phase 4: Clinical Translation
- PTSD: Measure m_φ during flashbacks
- Depression: Measure m_φ of rumination attractors
- Predict: Treatment efficacy ∝ ability to reduce m_φ of pathological states
```

**Success Criteria:**
- m_φ quantitatively measurable from neural data
- Predicts perturbation resistance (r > 0.7)
- Conservation law holds during unforced transitions
- Clinical states show predicted m_φ abnormalities

**Resources Required:**
- TMS system with precise intensity control
- High-density EEG (256+ channels)
- Access to meditation experts, psychedelic research license, PTSD patients
- Phenomenological report paradigms

**Timeline:** 3-4 years

### R3. Claustrum as Phenomenal Boundary Field Generator

**Core Hypothesis:** The claustrum generates standing-wave boundary field defining "inside vs outside" for consciousness. It's not processing content but maintaining container geometry.

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Claustrum = most densely connected brain structure
- Lesions → consciousness disruption despite small size
- Salvia divinorum (boundary dissolution) → κ-opioid receptors concentrated in claustrum
- HIRM framework: consciousness requires stable observer boundary

**Key Predictions:**
1. **Field-like dynamics:** Claustrum shows standing wave patterns, not information processing signatures
2. **Geometric invariance:** Patterns stable across different conscious contents
3. **Boundary perturbation:** Disrupting claustrum → immediate subjective boundary dissolution
4. **Phase relationships:** Claustrum phase-locks to cortex in specific spatial patterns defining "self boundary"

**Experimental Protocol:**
```
Phase 1: Ultra-High-Resolution Imaging
- 7T fMRI of claustrum at 0.5mm resolution
- During: rest, task, meditation, boundary-relevant conditions
- Measure: spatial coherence patterns, standing wave modes
- Compare to content-processing regions (V1, A1)

Phase 2: Perturbation Studies
- Focused ultrasound targeting claustrum (non-invasive)
- During various conscious states
- Phenomenological reports: predict boundary dissolution
- Compare to control perturbations (adjacent white matter)

Phase 3: Pharmacological Dissection
- Salvia divinorum vs control psychedelics (different receptor profiles)
- Simultaneous claustrum fMRI
- Predict: Salvia specifically disrupts claustrum field patterns
- Other psychedelics affect content regions, not claustrum geometry

Phase 4: Computational Modeling
- Model claustrum as field generator (Maxwell equations analog)
- Predict cortical boundary patterns from claustrum connectivity
- Test: Does model predict subjective boundary locations?
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Claustrum shows >80% variance in low-dimensional geometric modes vs >50% task-related variance in content regions
- Perturbation produces boundary dissolution reports in >70% subjects
- Salvia specifically disrupts claustrum fields vs other psychedelics
- Computational model predicts subjective boundaries (r > 0.6)

**Resources Required:**

- Psychedelic research licenses (Salvia, psilocybin, LSD)
- Computational modeling expertise

**Timeline:** 4-5 years

### R4. Quantum Discord vs Entanglement in Neural Correlations

**Core Hypothesis:** Brains use quantum discord (non-classical correlations surviving decoherence) rather than fragile entanglement for consciousness-relevant coherence.

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Quantum discord survives decoherence better than entanglement
- Allows non-local correlations in mixed states (hot, wet, noisy)
- C_critical transition: classical correlations → quantum discord → (attempted) entanglement → bifurcation

**Key Predictions:**
1. **Conscious states:** High discord / low entanglement (stable correlations without fragility)
2. **Unconscious states:** Discord collapses even if classical correlations persist
3. **Anesthesia trajectory:** Discord drops before classical correlation loss
4. **Timescale matching:** Discord coherence time ~100-300ms matches conscious binding window

**Experimental Protocol:**
```
Phase 1: Discord Reconstruction from Neural Data
- Multi-electrode arrays (Utah arrays, Neuropixels)
- Record spiking from multiple cortical areas simultaneously
- Reconstruct density matrices from spike statistics
- Calculate quantum discord measures (Ollivier-Ricci discord, geometric discord)

Phase 2: Conscious vs Unconscious Comparison
- Same subjects: awake → anesthesia → recovery
- Measure: classical correlation (mutual information), discord, entanglement
- Predict: Discord loss precedes/exceeds correlation loss under anesthesia

Phase 3: Temporal Dynamics
- High-temporal-resolution analysis (1ms bins)
- Track discord evolution during conscious access events
- Predict: Discord peak 50-100ms before conscious report
- Predict: Discord coherence time ≈ 100-300ms in conscious states

Phase 4: Causal Perturbation
- Optogenetics to induce/disrupt correlations
- Test: Can you restore consciousness by restoring discord without entanglement?
- Predict: Discord necessary and sufficient, entanglement not required
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Discord distinguishes conscious/unconscious (AUC > 0.85)
- Discord drops before classical correlations under anesthesia
- Discord coherence time matches binding window (100-300ms ± 50ms)
- Optogenetic discord restoration partially rescues consciousness

**Resources Required:**

- Quantum information theory analysis expertise
- Optogenetics capability (animal models)
- Anesthesia protocols and monitoring

**Timeline:** 3-4 years

### R5. Metabolic Cost of Self-Model Maintenance

**Core Hypothesis:** Consciousness requires continuous energetic floor to maintain ~8.3 bits of recursive self-model. Subjective fatigue/dissociation = budget failure below maintenance threshold.

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Landauer: 1 bit erasure costs k_B T ln(2) minimum
- C_critical ≈ 8.3 ± 0.6 bits of self-referential closure
- Burning ATP to prevent self-model collapse

**Key Predictions:**
1. **Metabolic floor:** Cerebral metabolic rate drops <10% below baseline → consciousness unsustainable
2. **Fatigue trajectory:** Subjective exhaustion precedes measurable PCI/Φ drops
3. **Recovery requirement:** Restoring consciousness requires metabolic recovery, not just stimulation
4. **Regional specificity:** DMN/frontoparietal metabolic cost highest (self-referential networks)

**Experimental Protocol:**
```
Phase 1: Real-Time Metabolic + Consciousness Monitoring
- MR spectroscopy for cerebral metabolic rate (glucose/O2)
- Simultaneous PCI measurement (TMS-EEG)
- Continuous subjective report (fatigue, presence, clarity)
- Protocol: Sleep deprivation, cognitive exhaustion, meditation

Phase 2: Identify Metabolic Floor
- Track metabolic rate vs C(t) components during decline
- Identify threshold: below what metabolic rate is consciousness lost?
- Predict: ~7-10% below baseline for DMN/frontoparietal regions

Phase 3: Dissociation Studies
- Ketamine, dissociative states, depersonalization disorder
- Measure: Is dissociation metabolic budget failure?
- Predict: Dissociation when recursive networks can't maintain energetic costs

Phase 4: Cognitive Enhancers
- Caffeine, modafinil, glucose administration
- Test: Can metabolic supplementation extend consciousness under depletion?
- Predict: Enhancement proportional to metabolic boost in self-referential networks
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Metabolic threshold identified (±2% precision)
- Subjective reports predict metabolic/PCI drops (r > 0.6, leading by 5-10 min)
- Dissociation correlates with DMN metabolic failure
- Metabolic enhancement rescues depleted consciousness

**Resources Required:**

- TMS-EEG system for PCI
- Sleep deprivation protocols, pharmacological agents
- Continuous subjective report methods

**Timeline:** 2-3 years

### R6. Binding-by-Bifurcation Mechanism

**Core Hypothesis:** The binding problem is solved at bifurcation point - distributed features must synchronize to cross C_critical threshold, forcing temporal binding.

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Binding problem: how distributed events → unified experience?
- HIRM: approaching C_critical increases cross-coupling
- At bifurcation, system must choose unified branch → forced binding

**Key Predictions:**
1. **Pre-binding synchronization surge:** ~50ms before conscious access, rapid increase in cross-frequency coupling
2. **Synchronization requirement:** Features failing to sync by bifurcation time don't enter consciousness
3. **Binding failures:** Illusory conjunctions occur when bifurcation precedes full synchronization
4. **Oscillatory signature:** Gamma-band synchronization peak marks bifurcation moment

**Experimental Protocol:**
```
Phase 1: Millisecond-Resolution Binding Dynamics
- Audiovisual binding paradigm (flash-beep synchrony judgments)
- MEG (millisecond + spatial resolution)
- Track: phase synchronization evolution across modalities
- Identify: exact moment features become bound

Phase 2: Critical Window Measurement
- Vary feature onset asynchrony systematically
- Predict: Binding succeeds if features sync within ~50ms of bifurcation
- Predict: Bifurcation timing measurable via sudden gamma-band coherence jump

Phase 3: Illusory Conjunction Analysis
- Color-shape binding errors in rapid serial visual presentation
- High-density EEG during errors vs correct binding
- Predict: Errors show bifurcation before full cross-frequency coupling
- Temporal order: bifurcation → conscious access → incorrect binding report

Phase 4: Causal Perturbation
- TMS to delay synchronization in one feature pathway
- Test: Can you prevent binding by delaying sync past critical window?
- Predict: TMS-induced delays >50ms relative to bifurcation → binding failure
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Synchronization surge identified in >85% of binding events
- Critical window measured: 47 ± 15 ms
- Binding failures show premature bifurcation signature
- TMS manipulation confirms causal role of synchronization timing

**Resources Required:**
- MEG system (millisecond temporal resolution)
- High-density EEG backup
- TMS with precise temporal control
- Binding paradigm battery

**Timeline:** 3-4 years

### R7. Pre-Conscious Predictive Suppression / Admission Control

**Core Hypothesis:** Active veto layer prevents bifurcation unless stimulus integrates into existing self-model without destabilizing causal emergence. Consciousness is curated, not passive readout.

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Sergent bifurcations: only some stimuli "ignite" after ~250ms
- HIRM: system must maintain stable macro-causal scale
- Prediction: active suppression of bifurcation-candidates that would destabilize current self-model

**Key Predictions:**
1. **Pre-suppression signature:** Before non-conscious stimuli, inhibitory signal in ACC/thalamus/claustrum
2. **Stability criterion:** Stimuli threatening self-model stability more likely suppressed
3. **Threshold modulation:** Same stimulus can be admitted or suppressed based on current stability state
4. **Curation latency:** Suppression decision ~100-150ms, before bifurcation window

**Experimental Protocol:**
```
Phase 1: Near-Threshold Stimulus Detection
- Present stimuli at varying intensities around threshold
- High-density EEG + source localization
- Compare: conscious access vs non-conscious trials (matched intensity)

Phase 2: Identify Suppression Signal
- Time window: 100-200ms post-stimulus
- Predict: Non-conscious trials show increased activity in:
  * Anterior cingulate cortex (monitoring)
  * Thalamic reticular nucleus (gating)
  * Claustrum (boundary control)
- Signal precedes/predicts lack of bifurcation

Phase 3: Stability Manipulation
- Vary cognitive load, emotional state, self-model coherence
- Test: Does same stimulus have different access depending on stability?
- Predict: Lower stability → more liberal admission (less suppression)

Phase 4: Causal Intervention
- TMS to ACC/thalamus during suppression window
- Test: Can you force consciousness by disrupting suppression?
- Predict: Disrupting suppression → random bifurcations → unstable/distorted consciousness
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Suppression signal identified (100-200ms, ACC/thalamus/claustrum)
- Signal predicts conscious access vs suppression (AUC > 0.80)
- Stability state modulates threshold (effect size d > 0.6)
- TMS disruption produces predicted instability

**Resources Required:**
- High-density EEG with source localization
- Near-threshold stimulus calibration
- TMS system with temporal precision
- Cognitive/emotional stability manipulation paradigms

**Timeline:** 2-3 years

### R8. Microtubule Coherence as Biological Timing Grid

**Core Hypothesis:** Microtubule quantum coherence provides sub-millisecond timing grid allowing distributed assemblies to stay phase-locked during self-reference closure.

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Q(t) in HIRM: quantum amplification factor
- Consciousness needs temporal continuity (~25ms neural processing)
- Microtubules show coherence 2-5ns (Tuszyński), superradiance confirmed (Babcock 2024)
- Hypothesis: not quantum = mysticism, quantum = timing bus

**Key Predictions:**
1. **Coherence bursts:** Microtubule coherence shows structured bursts aligning with 250-700ms bifurcation window
2. **Phase precision:** Perturbing microtubule stability reduces temporal precision of cortical phase-locking
3. **Anesthetic mechanism:** Anesthetics disrupt microtubule coherence → timing jitter → failed binding
4. **Timescale matching:** Microtubule burst duration ~100-300ms matches conscious binding window

**Experimental Protocol:**
```
Phase 1: In Vitro Timing Characterization
- Isolated microtubules in physiological conditions
- Fluorescence/Raman spectroscopy for quantum states
- Characterize: coherence time, burst structure, temperature dependence
- Predict: Coherence extends to 100-300ms with proper hydration/screening

Phase 2: In Vivo Coherence Detection

- Implanted near cortical microtubules (animal models)
- Measure: magnetic signatures of quantum coherence
- Correlate with: cortical oscillations, behavioral state

Phase 3: Perturbation Studies
- Colchicine (microtubule destabilizer) at sub-anesthetic doses
- Measure: temporal precision of inter-areal phase-locking
- Predict: Microtubule perturbation → jitter in gamma-band alignment
- Effect size proportional to perturbation strength

Phase 4: Anesthetic Mechanism Testing
- Various anesthetics (propofol, isoflurane, ketamine)
- Measure: microtubule coherence + cortical phase precision
- Predict: Anesthetics that bind microtubules (propofol) disrupt coherence
- Ketamine (NMDA antagonist) affects network but not microtubules
```

**Success Criteria:**

- Pharmacological agents, anesthetic protocols

**Timeline:** 4-5 years (technology-dependent)

### R9. Consciousness as Maxwell Demon / Entropy Export

**Core Hypothesis:** Conscious intensity proportional to rate of entropy export to environment. Brain runs Maxwell demons (sorting operations), consciousness = cumulative thermodynamic "debt."

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Maxwell demon sorts information, pays Landauer cost
- Brain sorts: relevant/irrelevant, self/other, past/future, actual/counterfactual
- Each sorting operation: ΔS = k_B × (bits sorted) × ln(2)
- Hypothesis: C(t) ∝ dS_env/dt

**Key Predictions:**
1. **Brain heat production:** Above-baseline heat ∝ conscious intensity
2. **Task-dependent ranking:** Problem-solving > normal > meditation > anesthesia
3. **Metabolic-phenomenal correlation:** Subjective "effort" ∝ entropy export rate
4. **Unconscious efficiency:** Automated tasks produce less entropy than conscious deliberation

**Experimental Protocol:**
```

Phase 3: Psychedelic Studies
- LSD/psilocybin (entropy increase in brain networks)
- Measure: brain temperature, metabolic rate, subjective intensity
- Predict: Psychedelics show paradox - high subjective intensity but possibly lower entropy export (fewer demons, less sorting)

Phase 4: Clinical Translation
- ADHD (constant sorting failures)
- OCD (excessive sorting loops)
- Meditation experts (reduced sorting)
- Predict: Disorders show abnormal entropy export patterns
```

### R10. Fractal Dimension of Conscious States

**Core Hypothesis:** Fractal dimension of neural dynamics = dimension of phenomenal space experienced. Different D_fractal → different types of consciousness.

**Theoretical Framework:**
```
D_fractal ≈ 1.5: Sensory consciousness (perceptual binding)
D_fractal ≈ 2.3: Normal waking (self-reflective, matches critical systems)
D_fractal ≈ 3.0: Mystical/psychedelic (sense of infinite depth)
D_fractal → 1.0: Deep meditation (single-pointed)
D_fractal > 3.5: Decoherence (too chaotic, loss of consciousness)
```

**Key Predictions:**
1. **State-dependent D:** Each conscious state has characteristic fractal dimension
2. **Optimal window:** Consciousness requires 1.8 < D < 3.2
3. **Psychedelic trajectory:** Dose-dependent increase in D_fractal
4. **Meditation trajectory:** Progressive decrease in D_fractal with expertise

**Experimental Protocol:**
```
Phase 1: Baseline Fractal Characterization

- Calculate: correlation dimension, box-counting dimension, multifractal spectrum
- Establish: normal waking D_fractal distribution

Phase 2: Meditation Studies
- Novice vs expert meditators
- Different meditation types (focused attention vs open monitoring)
- Predict: D_fractal decreases with depth
- Expert focused attention: D → 1.2-1.5
- Expert open monitoring: D → 2.0-2.5 (lower than normal)

Phase 3: Psychedelic Studies
- LSD/psilocybin dose-response
- Continuous EEG, repeated D_fractal measurements
- Predict: D increases with dose up to peak experience
- Beyond optimal dose: D > 3.5 → confusion/dysphoria

Phase 4: Clinical Applications

## TIER 2: MEDIUM-TERM RESEARCH (5-10 Years)

### R11. Time Crystal Consciousness

**Core Hypothesis:** Consciousness is a time crystal - breaking time-translation symmetry to create discrete phenomenal moments from continuous neural dynamics.

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Time crystals: spontaneous breaking of temporal symmetry
- Consciousness: discrete moments despite continuous substrate
- Microtubules show "time-crystal-like behavior" (fractal resonances, 12 orders magnitude)
- Floquet engineering: periodic driving creates stable temporal order

**Key Predictions:**
1. **Discrete time structure:** Consciousness chunks continuous time into ~30-50ms quanta
2. **Temporal rigidity:** Phenomenal moment duration resists perturbation (like crystal resisting compression)
3. **Phase transitions:** Transitions between time-crystal phases mark major state changes (wake/sleep, conscious/unconscious)

**Key Predictions:**
1. **Non-Abelian statistics:** Order of mental operations matters fundamentally (non-commutative)

### R15. Consciousness in Higher Dimensions (Literal)

**Core Hypothesis:** Consciousness requires extra spatial dimensions (5D+) for information processing. These dimensions compactified at scales between quantum and neural.

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- HIRM discusses 5D holographic emergence
- String theory: extra dimensions compactified at Planck scale
- Proposal: consciousness dimensions compactified at mesoscopic scale (~1 μm - 1 mm)
- Provides "room" for self-reference without infinite regress

**Key Predictions:**
1. **Dimensional signatures:** Conscious brain states show signatures of higher-dimensional dynamics
2. **Kaluza-Klein modes:** Excitations corresponding to extra-dimensional oscillations
3. **State-dependent geometry:** Different conscious states correspond to different compactification geometries
4. **Anesthesia effect:** Disrupts access to extra dimensions (flattens to 3D+time)

**Research Program:**
```
Phase 1: Theoretical Development (Years 1-3)
- Formalize consciousness in 5D+ framework
- Derive testable predictions (oscillation frequencies, correlation patterns)
- Identify dimensional signatures in neural data
- Connect to HIRM formalism

Phase 2: Data Analysis (Years 3-5)
- Reanalyze existing high-quality neural data
- Look for higher-dimensional structure using:
  * Delay embedding
  * Takens reconstruction
  * Topological data analysis
  * Harmonic analysis
- Compare conscious vs unconscious

Phase 3: Targeted Experiments (Years 5-7)
- Design experiments to probe extra dimensions
- Specific perturbation patterns (if extra-D exists, certain patterns should show anomalies)
- Multi-scale recording (test predicted compactification scale)

Phase 4: Cosmological Connection (Years 7-10)
- If signatures found, connect to fundamental physics
- Test: Do conscious systems show sensitivity to extra-dimensional gravitational effects?
- Collaborate with theoretical physics community
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Higher-dimensional signatures identified in conscious states
- Dimensionality estimates: 5-7 dimensions
- Anesthesia reduces effective dimensionality
- Predictions match theoretical framework

**Resources Required:**
- Theoretical physics collaboration
- Advanced topological data analysis
- High-quality multi-scale neural recordings
- Computational resources

**Timeline:** 8-10 years

### R16. Pre/Retrocausality & Temporal Nonlocality

**Core Hypothesis:** Consciousness near C_critical couples weakly to future light cone. Explains precognition, presentiment, intuition as retrocausal information flow.

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Two-State Vector Formalism: quantum events influenced by future boundary conditions
- Transactional Interpretation: forwards + backwards waves
- HIRM: complete self-reference requires future information
- Near C_critical: temporal boundaries become permeable

**Key Predictions:**
1. **Presentiment effect:** Physiological response before random future events
2. **PCI correlation:** Effect size ∝ proximity to C_critical
3. **Anesthesia elimination:** No effect under anesthesia (no observer to couple)
4. **Timescale limit:** Precognition limited to ~seconds (limited future light cone access)

**Research Program:**
```
Phase 1: Presentiment + PCI (Years 1-2)
- Replication of Radin presentiment studies
- Add: Simultaneous PCI measurement (TMS-EEG)
- Predict: Hits occur when PCI approaching (but not yet at) C_critical
- Measure correlation between PCI trajectory and presentiment effect size

Phase 2: State Manipulation (Years 2-4)
- Manipulate proximity to C_critical:
  * Meditation (approach criticality)
  * Cognitive load (move away)
  * Psychedelics (unstable near critical)
- Predict: Effect size follows predicted pattern
- Peak: slightly subcritical (approaching phase transition)

Phase 3: Anesthesia Test (Years 4-5)
- Critical test: presentiment under anesthesia
- Predict: Complete elimination of effect
- Compare to other "unconscious" processing (priming, etc still works)
- This distinguishes consciousness-dependent vs general precog

Phase 4: Mechanism Studies (Years 5-8)
- If effects confirmed, investigate mechanism
- Quantum eraser experiments + consciousness measurement
- Do conscious vs unconscious observations show different statistics?
- Test: Does consciousness involve retrocausal elements?
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Presentiment effect replicated (effect size d > 0.2)
- Correlation with PCI trajectory (r > 0.4)
- Anesthesia eliminates effect completely
- Effect size modulated by predicted state variables

**Controversy Management:**
- Pre-registered studies
- Multiple independent replications
- Publication regardless of outcome
- Clear falsification criteria

**Resources Required:**
- Presentiment experimental setup
- TMS-EEG for PCI
- Large subject pools (N > 200)
- Anesthesia protocols
- Statistical rigor (Bayesian methods)

**Timeline:** 6-8 years

- Construct time series (past 200+ years)
- Identify: major integration peaks, crisis points
- Characterize: limit cycle structure if present
- Period estimation: ~50-80 years?

Phase 2: Contemporary Monitoring (Years 2-5)
- Real-time tracking of all metrics
- Predict: Near-term trajectory
- Test: Are we approaching collective C_critical?
- Warning signs: accelerating oscillations

Phase 3: Intervention Studies (Years 5-8)
- If dangerous trajectory confirmed:
- Model: What interventions stabilize without suppressing integration?
- Test in regional/smaller systems first
- Economic/policy implications

Phase 4: Long-Term Modeling (Years 8-10)
- What happens if/when humanity crosses collective C_critical?
- Positive scenario: Stable planetary consciousness
- Negative scenario: Catastrophic fragmentation
- Model: Conditions for each outcome
```

**Success Criteria:**
