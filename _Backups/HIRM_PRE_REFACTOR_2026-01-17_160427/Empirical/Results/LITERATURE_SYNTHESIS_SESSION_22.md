## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Literature review reveals strong empirical support for all three HIRM components decreasing during unconscious states (sleep N3, anesthesia). Key findings:

| Component | Measure | Wake/REM | N3/Anesthesia | HIRM Prediction |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Criticality | DFA exponent | ~1.0 | ~1.5 | [SUPPORTED] |
| Phi | Integration | High | Low | [SUPPORTED] |
| R | Metacognition | High | Reduced | [SUPPORTED] |
| D | Complexity | High | Low | [SUPPORTED] |
| Hysteresis | EC50 ratio | N/A | Induction != Emergence | [SUPPORTED] |

## 1. CRITICALITY (Underlying all C components)

### 1.1 Sleep Stage Criticality
**Source:** Oxford Academic SLEEP, Oct 2025 (n=3192 children)

Key finding: "In synchronized N3 sleep, the DFA exponent remains at ~1.5 across all ages, indicating highly regular, Brownian-like activity far from criticality."

- Wake/REM: DFA exponent approaches 1.0 (critical, scale-free)
- N3: DFA exponent ~1.5 (subcritical, Brownian)
- Developmental: Light sleep DFA evolves from 1.5 to ~1.0 with age

**Implication for HIRM:** N3 = subcritical = low C(t), supporting phase transition model

### 1.2 Spectral Slope Changes
**Source:** Frontiers Neuroinformatics, Sept 2022 (n=251)

"Spectral slope showed especially large and consistent variability between sleep stages"
- Wake: Shallower slopes (closer to 1/f)
- N3: Steeper slopes (departure from criticality)
- REM: Intermediate (but elevated relative to N2)

### 1.3 Theta/Delta Burst Dynamics
**Source:** PLOS CompBio, Nov 2019; J Neuroscience, Jan 2020

"Remarkable duality of power-law scale-invariant dynamics for theta-bursts and Weibull dynamics with characteristic time scale for delta-bursts"

- Theta (wake/REM-associated): Power-law = critical
- Delta (N3-associated): Weibull = subcritical
- This duality preserved across sleep-wake cycle

---

## 2. INTEGRATION (Phi Component)

### 2.1 Phi Decreases During Unconsciousness
**Source:** Oxford Academic Neuroscience of Consciousness, Feb 2025

"Phi decreased during anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness at both global and local levels. Similarly, Phi was locally reduced within a system centered on posterior brain regions during sleep-induced loss of consciousness."

- Anesthesia: Global and local Phi reduction
- Sleep: Local Phi reduction in posterior regions
- Recovery: Phi restoration correlates with consciousness return

### 2.2 Integration-Segregation Balance
**Source:** Nature Communications, Oct 2024

"Profound shift towards segregation of brain networks during anesthesia"
- ISD (Integration-Segregation Difference) tracks consciousness
- Machine learning: integration/segregation data predicts state
- Unimodal-transmodal sequence during induction/emergence

### 2.3 Phi Proxy Measures
**Source:** Frontiers Human Neuroscience, Feb 2018

"Phi alone is insufficient to discriminate certain states of anesthesia. However, a multi-dimensional parameter space extended by four parameters related to Phi and EEG connectivity is able to differentiate all states."

- Consistent with HIRM's multiplicative model (Phi alone insufficient)
- Need integration + connectivity (potentially R, D proxies)

---

## 3. SELF-REFERENCE (R Component)

### 3.1 Metacognition Reduced During Sleep
**Source:** J Cognitive Neuroscience, 2017

"Waking thoughts had more metacognitive content than thoughts during both NREM and REM sleep"
- Wake: Prefrontal regions differentially active for metacognition
- NREM/REM: "Significant differences in prefrontal activation were not observed"
- Medial prefrontal cortex = metacognitive content in wake

### 3.2 Default Mode Network Integrity
**Source:** Cerebral Cortex, Sept 2011

"With increasing sleep depth, contributions of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/retrosplenial cortex (RspC), parahippocampal gyrus, and medial prefrontal cortex to the DMN decreased."

- DMN = self-referential processing network
- Sleep depth correlates with DMN disintegration
- Consistent with R component reduction

### 3.3 Lucid Dreaming as R Restoration
**Source:** PMC Sleep Research

"Periods of lucid dreaming show increased activity in areas such as the DLPFC, bilateral frontopolar prefrontal cortex, and parietal areas"
- Lucid dreaming = metacognition restored during REM
- "Reinstantiation of reflective capabilities"
- Demonstrates R component can be selectively enhanced

---

## 4. DIMENSIONALITY/COMPLEXITY (D Component)

### 4.1 Attractor Dimensionality
**Source:** Int J Clin Monitor Comput, 1988; Frontiers Neurosci, 2018

"EEG progresses from 'chaos' (awake) to progressively more 'ordered' attractors (anesthetized and burst suppression)"

- Phase space analysis: Higher dimensionality when conscious
- Correlation dimension decreases with anesthesia depth
- Time-delayed embeddings show structural changes

### 4.2 Entropy Measures
**Source:** PLOS ONE, 2015; PMC Communications Biology, 2023

"Complexity of multi-dimensional spontaneous EEG decreases during propofol induced general anesthesia"
- Lempel-Ziv complexity: Decreases with unconsciousness
- Multiscale entropy: Scale-dependent changes at LOC
- Entropy-based biomarkers outperform spectral features

### 4.3 Criticality Predicts Perturbational Complexity
**Source:** PubMed, Oct 2023

"States of unconsciousness were characterized by departure from criticality... We were then able to predict individual subjects' PCI with a mean absolute error below 7%"

- Avalanche criticality measures predict PCI
- Establishes link between criticality and complexity
- Supports HIRM's integration of these concepts

---

## 5. HYSTERESIS (Bistability Prediction)

### 5.1 Neural Inertia Confirmed
**Source:** PMC Distinct Neural Mechanisms, 2025

"Hysteresis/neural inertia, an intrinsic tendency of the central nervous system to resist transitions between unconscious and conscious states... cannot be solely explained by pharmacokinetics"

- EC50(induction) != EC50(emergence)
- Distinct neural circuits for each direction
- Orexinergic neurons: Selective emergence regulation

### 5.2 Asymmetric Neural Dynamics
**Source:** PMC Neuroimage, Aug 2021

"LOR and ROR occurred at substantially different effect-site propofol concentrations... forming a closed loop commonly known as hysteresis"

- Temporal autocorrelation: Gradual increase to LOC
- Functional connectivity: Gradual decrease to LOC
- Recovery: Abrupt cortical, then subcortical restoration

### 5.3 Thalamocortical Boot-Up Sequence
**Source:** PNAS, July 2017

"Asymmetry in cortical, thalamic, and thalamocortical dynamics during induction and emergence appears consistent with previous reports of hysteresis"

- Midline/intralaminar thalamus recovers first
- Then sensory-motor thalamic divisions
- Suggests hierarchical reactivation

## 6. IMPLICATIONS FOR HIRM

### 6.1 All Components Decrease Together
The literature consistently shows that during unconscious states:
- Criticality departs from optimal (DFA != 1.0)
- Integration (Phi) decreases
- Self-reference (R/metacognition) decreases
- Dimensionality (D/complexity) decreases

This supports the multiplicative model C = Phi x R x D

### 6.2 Phase Transition Framework Supported
- Hysteresis = bistability near critical threshold
- Different EC50 for induction vs emergence
- "Neural inertia" = metastable conscious/unconscious states

### 6.3 Quantitative Predictions Remain Untested
- C_critical = 8.3 bits threshold: Not directly tested
- Component independence: Unknown empirically
- Exact hysteresis ratio: Not quantified against HIRM prediction

---

## 7. GAPS FOR EMPIRICAL WORK

### 7.1 Direct C(t) Computation
No study has computed C = Phi x R x D using HIRM operationalizations

### 7.2 Threshold Testing
Need to test whether C < 8.3 in N3/anesthesia and C > 8.3 in wake

### 7.3 Component Correlations
Independence assumption untested with real data

### 7.4 Hysteresis Quantification
EC50_emergence / EC50_induction ratio vs HIRM prediction (1.3-1.5)
