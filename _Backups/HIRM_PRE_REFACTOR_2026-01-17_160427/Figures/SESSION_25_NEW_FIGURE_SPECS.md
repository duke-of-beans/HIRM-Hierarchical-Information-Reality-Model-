# FIGURE C: ZERO-MULTIPLIER THEOREM VISUALIZATION
## New Figure (Session 24)

**Type:** Three-panel comparison
**Purpose:** Validate C(t) = Phi x R x D multiplicative structure

**Panel A: Normal Consciousness**
```
Phi = HIGH (0.8)
 R  = HIGH (0.9)
 D  = HIGH (0.7)
------------------
C(t) = 0.8 x 0.9 x 0.7 = 0.504
     = ~12 bits (above threshold)
     => CONSCIOUS
```

**Panel B: Meditation Cessation**
```
Phi = HIGH (0.75) [Complexity preserved]
 R  = ZERO (0.0)  [Self-reference suspended]
 D  = NORMAL (0.6)
------------------
C(t) = 0.75 x 0.0 x 0.6 = 0.0
     = 0 bits (ZERO!)
     => UNCONSCIOUS despite high Phi
```

**Panel C: Ant Colony**
```
Phi = HIGH (0.85) [Collective integration]
 R  = ZERO (0.0)  [No unified self-reference]
 D  = HIGH (0.7)
------------------
C(t) = 0.85 x 0.0 x 0.7 = 0.0
     = 0 bits (ZERO!)
     => NOT CONSCIOUS
```

**Key Message:** "If ANY factor = 0, consciousness = 0"

**Comparison Table:**
| System | Phi | R | D | C(t) | Conscious? |
|--------|-----|---|---|------|------------|
| Human waking | HIGH | HIGH | HIGH | >>8.3 | YES |
| Human cessation | HIGH | ZERO | ? | 0 | NO |
| Ant colony | HIGH | ZERO | HIGH | 0 | NO |
| Simple feedback | ZERO | HIGH | LOW | 0 | NO |
| Deep sleep | LOW | LOW | LOW | <8.3 | NO |

# FIGURE D: COMPARATIVE STATE DIAGRAM
## New Figure (Session 24)

**Type:** 2D scatter plot
**Purpose:** Map states in C(t) vs PIS space

**Axes:**
- X: Instantaneous consciousness C(t) [0 to supercritical]
- Y: PIS integrity [0 to 1]

**Points plotted:**
- Normal waking: HIGH C(t), HIGH PIS
- Deep sleep: LOW C(t), HIGH PIS  
- Meditation cessation: ZERO C(t), FULL PIS [!]
- NDE surge: SUPERCRITICAL C(t), ENHANCED PIS access [!]
- Coma: ZERO C(t), VARIABLE PIS
- Death: ZERO C(t), ZERO PIS

**Key insight:** C(t) and PIS are partially independent

---

# FIGURE E: CESSATION VS NDE COMPARISON
## New Figure (Session 24)

**Type:** Two-panel contrast diagram
**Purpose:** Show opposite extremes both preserve identity

**Panel Left - CESSATION:**
```
C(t) = 0 (no consciousness)
R = 0 (self-reference suspended)
Phi = HIGH (complexity preserved)
PIS = INTACT (identity continuous)

Voluntary | Seconds-Minutes | Full recovery
```

**Panel Right - NDE SURGE:**
```
C(t) >> C_critical (supercritical)
R = ENHANCED (hyperconnected)
Phi = MAXIMAL (gamma surge)
PIS = ENHANCED ACCESS (life review)

Involuntary | 10-30 seconds | Variable recovery
```

**Center connection:** Both demonstrate PIS independence from C(t)

# FIGURE F: BLOCKAGE ANALYSIS DIAGRAM
## New Figure (Session 24)

**Type:** Decision tree
**Purpose:** Show where consciousness fails

**Tree:**
```
Is network connected? (lambda > lambda_c)
    |
   NO --> UNCONSCIOUS (Level 1 blockage)
          Example: Deep anesthesia
    |
   YES
    |
    v
Is criticality maintained? (sigma ~ 1)
    |
   NO --> UNCONSCIOUS (Level 2 blockage)
          Example: N3 deep sleep
    |
   YES
    |
    v
Is C(t) > C_critical?
    |
   NO --> UNCONSCIOUS (Level 3 blockage)
          Example: DOC patient
    |
   YES (but check components)
    |
    v
Is R > 0?
    |
   NO --> UNCONSCIOUS (Zero-multiplier)
          Example: Meditation cessation
    |
   YES --> CONSCIOUS

```
